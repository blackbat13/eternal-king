# The Barista Experience

The espresso machine birhed a live octopus.  

Lorain stared at the cephalopod now suction-cupping its way across *The Coffee Cauldron*’s counter, ink pooling around her “#1 Barista!” pin. Behind her, a line of yoga moms tapped designer sneakers to the rhythm of Damien’s latest prank—a cursed Spotify playlist that turned Taylor Swift lyrics into Sumerian death chants.  

“*Papa,*” she hissed through a customer-service grin, scrambling to hide the creature under a scone wrapper. “I told you—no interventions during my probation period!”  

Damien materialized in the pick-up zone wearing a UPS uniform stretched taut over non-Euclidian musculature. “Darling, watching you debase yourself for ‘minimum wage’ is intervention-worthy.” He plucked the octopus, which morphed into a bouquet of screaming peonies. “For your nice manager. The one with the failing marriage and parasitic twin.”  

Lorain’s eye twitched. Three weeks into her first mortal job, and already her manager’s hair had turned sentient. She’d found the strands forming accusatory braille messages in the mop bucket.  

A customer cleared their throat—seven throats, actually, layered in harmonic minor. Lorain turned to face a being wearing three trench coats and the existential dread of a thousand commuters.  

“Venti chai latte,” it intoned, eyeless gaze fixed on Damien. “Extra cinnamon. Extra souls.”  

Damien leaned across the counter, his nametag now reading *‘Hi! I’m SATAN’S BABYSITTER!’* “Ah! The Ninth Harbinger of Office Burnout! How’s the whole ‘crushing hope via TPS reports’ gig?”  

The fluorescents flickered. Lorain’s apron burst into eldritch flames.  

“*Out.*” She shoved Damien toward the stockroom, where the bags of Colombian Dark Roast had begun reciting erotic poetry. “I need this job to pay rent on my *non-screaming* apartment!”  

“About that…” Damien snapped his fingers. The health inspection certificate mutated, revealing a new clause: *EMPLOYEE SHALL PROVIDE WEEKLY TRIBUTE OF BLOOD TYPE AB-NEGATIVE.* “Your ‘landlord’ is actually a retired nephilim taxidermist. Fascinating hobbyist!”  

The fire alarm sprouted teeth. Lorain’s shift supervisor—a witch from Staten Island moonlighting as a mortal—materialized in a cloud of vape smoke. “Lorain! Your dad’s making Karens levitate in Drive-Thru again!”  

“He’s *not* my—”  

Too late. Through the window, they watched a minivan full of soccer moms ascend toward the blood moon, caramel macchiatos still clutched in their French-tipped claws.  

Damien inspected a gluten-free muffin like it’d personally offended him. “You could be ruling a nightmare dimension right now. But no—*barista.*” He spat the word like a curse. “At least let me upgrade your tip jar into a soul prison.”  

The bell jingled. Five women entered wearing Lorain’s face.  

Her real mother’s coven placed their orders in unison: “One child-stealing warlock, extra foam. And a *reunion* blend to go.”  

The coffee grinder erupted with black flames. Lorain felt her borrowed organs shift—Damien’s last-ditch “gift” on her 18th birthday, when the coven’s first harvest attempt left her needing replacement kidneys forged from neutron star matter.  

“Crème brûlée latte,” the lead witch crooned, tracing a finger through cursed steam. “Just like your *real* mother used to make.”  

Damien went very still. The air tasted of ozone and paternal rage.  

Lorain slammed down a spray bottle of holy water. “*Enough.*” She turned to her shift supervisor. “I’m taking my ten.”  

In the alley behind the dumpsters full of sentient coffee grounds, she whirled on Damien. “Fix this. *Now.*”  

He arched a brow. “Demanding today, aren’t we?”  

“You turned my health insurance into a sentient poltergeist! My 401(k) is a *literal* wishing well to Tartarus!” She jabbed a finger at his chest, ignoring the way reality warped around her touch. “I just want *one* normal thing that’s *mine.*”  

For a heartbeat, the King of Chaos looked... chastised. Then he smirked.  

“Fine.” He tossed her a name tag that squirmed like a living thing. “But you’re handling the next Karen uprising without celestial backup.”  

Back inside, the coven had multiplied into a mirror-maze of Lorain’s stolen genetics. They’d enchanted the espresso machine to bleed.  

“Oops,” Damien singsonged, materializing the employee bathroom. “Looks like you’ll need to unionize!”  

Lorain grabbed the cursed whipped cream canister.  

It was going to be a long shift.
