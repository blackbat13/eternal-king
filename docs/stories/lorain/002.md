# 18th Birthday

The cake was alive.  

Lorain stared at the writhing confection perched atop Damien’s grand piano—a seven-tiered monstrosity frosted with what appeared to be sentient cream cheese. Candles shaped like screaming cherubs melted wax tears onto the surface.  

“You *literally* had one job,” she said, clutching the edge of her thrift-store prom dress. “Normal. Human. Birthday.”  

Damien materialized beside her in a puff of sulfur and Axe body spray, his mortal-disguise jeans distressingly tight. “And deprive you of tradition?” He flicked a candle. A cherub burst into flames. “Eighteen mortal years! Do you know what I unleashed upon the cosmos when *I* turned eighteen eons? The Andromeda Plague. Adorable pustules.”  

“You promised no eldritch horrors this year.”  

“These?” He plucked a candle, its wick hissing in Enochian. “Borrowed them from your Pinterest board. ‘Cottagecore Apocalypse.’”  

The castle chose that moment to vomit forth the party guests.  

Lorain’s geometry teacher oozed from the grandfather clock, his skin now translucent and full of swimming eels. The barista from Starbucks sprouted antlers made of espresso grounds. And there, hovering near the punch bowl of liquid starlight—  

“Mrs. O’Hara?” Lorain choked.  

The baker floated six inches off the floor, eyes twin supernovas. “Your father and I have been *communing*,” she purred, a tentacle unfurling from her apron to caress Damien’s shoulder.  

“Kill me,” Lorain whispered.  

“Now now,” Damien clapped, sending shockwaves through the chandelier of frozen screams. “Gifts!”  

The geometry teacher lurched forward, offering a Klein bottle filled with sobbing dark matter. The barista presented a necklace of teeth from a dead god’s wisdom molars. Mrs. O’Hara—  

“A down payment on your first soul!”  

Lorain stared at the snow globe in her hands. Inside, a tiny figure in a sweater pummeled a miniature Damien with a couch cushion. “This is…”  

“Sentimental drivel,” Damien sniffed, adjusting his crown as the piano began playing *Happy Birthday* in the key of dying suns. “Merely a recording of your most tedious childhood moments. Destroy it if you—”  

The floor buckled.  

Lorain’s palms bled black smoke.  

“Ah.” Damien stilled, his human disguise burning away to reveal the primordial void beneath. “Right on schedule.”  

The cake exploded.  

From its frosting guts rose nine women wearing her mother’s face.  

“Happy birthday, little cuckoo,” the coven crooned in unison, their voices peeling wallpaper to reveal pulsating flesh walls. “Time to come home to the nest.”  

Lorain felt it then—the thing Damien had sewn into her ribs at midnight feedings, the reason her lungs kept failing. It uncoiled.  

“Papa?” Her voice echoed with static from beyond the stars.  

Damien smiled, all teeth and collapsing realities. “Blow out your candles, little sparrow.”  

The cherubs screamed as she inhaled.
