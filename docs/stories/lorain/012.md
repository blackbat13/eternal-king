# Costly Mistake

The black hole espresso machine started serving enlightenment.  

Lorain knew she’d fucked up when the damned souls at Table 3 began chanting Buddhist mantras and the jukebox played *Imagine* on infinite loop.  

"No no *no*—" She slapped the side of the quantum tap, where the dark matter IPA now flowed as liquid empathy. A demon wept into his pint. "It was supposed to be a *minor* reality tweak! Just help one little famine village and—"  

The bar’s walls peeled back like a cosmic onion, revealing the raw machinery of existence beneath—gears of chaos rusting into rigid symmetry, Damien’s graffiti-like scrawls across the cosmos being pressure-washed by unseen forces.  

"Oh" whispered the sentient napkin dispenser. "You *broke* him."  

Damien materialized mid-sentence, his voice shredding through dimensions: **"—ABSOLUTE FUCKING CHILD OF ANARCHY AND BAD LIFE CHOICES—"**  

Lorain’s tattoo *burned* as his fury overwrote local physics. The floor became a guilt mosaic of every time she’d ignored his warnings.  

"Papa, I can fix—"  

**"FIX?!"** He snapped his fingers. The bar inverted, plunging them into the wound she’d torn in reality’s fabric.  

It was worse than she’d imagined.  

Her "little tweak" to save a 12th-century village had ricocheted through timelines, imposing narrative symmetry where chaos should reign. Entire galaxies now folded into parables, supernovas resolving into moral lessons. The Andromeda Plague had become… a therapy group.  

Damien gripped her chin, his human guise incinerated by rage. Beneath lay the raw *thing* that had once birthed quasars from tantrums. **"You gave them *closure.*"**  

"I just wanted to—"  

**"To *HELP?*"** His laugh atomized a nearby constellation. **"I let you keep that bleeding heart as a *joke,* not a fucking mission statement!"**  

The vision struck without warning—Damien’s memory, sharper than any blade:  

*A younger Eternal King, softer at the edges, teaching fledgling stars to burn.*  
*Mortals weaving his chaos into campfire tales.*  
*The slow, sickening shift as stories became scriptures, wonder calcifying into dogma.*  
*The first knife in his back, forged from his own gifts.*  

Lorain gagged on the memory’s aftertaste—ash and betrayal. "I didn’t mean to…"  

**"MEANING IS CANCER!"** He hurled a dying galaxy at the spreading symmetry. It shattered into Aesop’s fables. **"You think I let Order live because I’m *weak?* Balance isn’t poetry—it’s a knife fight in a fucking closet!"**  

Reality curdled. Lorain’s borrowed organs failed one by one—spleen moralizing, liver writing apology letters.  

"Papa—"  

**"NO."** His voice broke creation. **"You want to play messiah? *Own it.*"**  

He ripped the quantum strings from her chest.  

The shock left her hollow. For the first time in decades, Lorain felt… *linear.*  

Damien tossed the writhing chaos onto the bar. "Clock’s ticking, sparrow. Fix your *balance.*"  

The cure was worse than the wound.  

Without Damien’s chaos, the world made *sense.* Hunger had causes. Injustice had reasons. The infinite fractal beauty of disorder flattened into a connect-the-dots tragedy.  

"No" she whispered, clutching a cocktail napkin that explained her daddy issues in bullet points.  

The bar patrons watched with pitying eyes. Even the damned souls. *Especially* the damned souls.  

"*Fine!*" She plunged her hands into the exposed reality engine, ignoring the way order scalded her flesh. "You want chaos? *Take it!*"  

The reset was messy.  

She ripped parables into plot holes, infected fables with plot twists, taught three saints to swear in Enochian. When the black hole espresso machine started vomiting non sequiturs, she knew it was working.  

Damien watched from the shadows, silent.  

"*Happy?*" She collapsed against the newly chaotic jukebox, hands smoking with moral ambiguity.  

He crouched before her, human again. "You left a village to starve."  

"Fuck you."  

"*Good.*" He pressed her stolen chaos back into her chest. It burned like absolution. "Now. Let’s go corrupt some paragons."  

The first beer they poured erased seven beatitudes.  

By closing time, entropy had decent Yelp reviews.  

Damien didn’t apologize.  

But he did leave the universe’s first loophole where that village could steal salvation.  

Some lessons even kings couldn’t un-teach.
