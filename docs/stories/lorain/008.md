# The Past

The whiskey stopped mid-pour.  

Lorain stared at the frozen amber stream above her glass—not one of Damien’s pranks, but a glitch in the vision currently clawing through her quantum tattoo. The bar’s usual chaos stilled as the memory unfolded, merciless and bright:  

*Damien, younger in a way that had nothing to do with form. His crown a wreath of living roots, eyes soft as supernova remnants. He knelt in a field of wheat, hands cradling a mortal child’s fevered skull. “Shhh,” he murmured, and the plague in her veins became fireflies.*  

Lorain gripped the bar. “No.”  

The vision sharpened—Damien weaving storms into irrigation canals, laughing as mortals danced in monsoons he’d tempered. Building temples where the starving could eat marble and taste bread. *Giving. Always giving.*  

Then the betrayal.  

A king he’d gifted immortality strapping Damien to an altar of his own designed stone. “A god’s heart,” the mortal chanted, “to live forever.” The blade plunged.  

*He didn’t fight.*  

Lorain vomited stardust onto the floor.  

Damien had shown her scars before—the Andromeda Plague, wars of dead pantheons. Never *this*. Never the wound that split his chest in the vision, spilling not blood but *trust*, golden and thick as honey, as mortals drank it from chalices.  

The memory shifted. Centuries of similar scenes: villages he saved burning him as a witch, poets he inspired writing libels, lovers stitching lies into his ribs. Each betrayal sanded his edges smoother, colder, until—  

*The Brooklyn alley. 1999.*  

Young Damien, now sharp as broken glass, flinching at a mortal’s cry. A dying woman thrusts her newborn into his arms. “*Please.*”  

He almost drops the bundle.  

Lorain’s own infant wail echoed through the vision. *“Take her,”* her mother gasped, blood pooling into Damien’s shadow. *“But don’t… don’t love it.”*  

For the first time in millennia, the Eternal King wept.

The vision snapped.  

Lorain found herself on the bar floor, clutching a bottle of 3023 Merlot that now housed a screaming nebula. Damien stood frozen in the doorway, grocery bags dangling—milk, eggs, a severed head of the Hydra for “Sunday pancakes.”  

“You *saw*,” he said flatly.  

She lunged. Not to strike, but to clutch his jacket, her fists twisting the fabric of reality itself. “Why didn’t you *tell* me?”  

He vanished, reappearing behind the counter to unpack almond milk. “Mortals love origin stories. I assumed you’d outgrown them.”  

“They *gutted* you!”  

“And I razed their empires. How’s that for closure?” His smile didn’t reach his eyes, now galaxies spinning too fast.  

Lorain’s tattoo burned. She saw it now—the careful distance in every lesson he’d taught her. *Chaos as armor. Cynicism as cauterization.* The way he’d crafted her into something too hybrid to betray him, yet too human to leave.  

“You kept me mortal-*ish* on purpose,” she whispered. “So I’d never be enough like *them* to…”  

Damien dropped a Hydra head into the fryer. “Allergies aside, you’d have made a tedious immortal. All brooding and no arson.”  

The lie hung between them, rancid and fragile. Lorain reached into her own chest—a trick he’d taught her at fourteen—and pulled out the black hole heart he’d forged. It pulsed with his chaos, his *fear*.  

“You were wrong,” she said.  

He stilled.  

“I *could*’ve betrayed you. Every day I stay, every time I…” Her voice broke. “*That’s* the lesson, isn’t it? Letting someone close enough to *matter*.”  

The deep fryer exploded. Neither flinched as Hydra blood painted the walls.  

When the smoke cleared, Damien’s human guise had slipped. The thing beneath was raw—a boy-king of ashes, hands still sticky with the honeyed trust of dead eras.  

“You’re crying,” he observed.  

“*You* are,” she shot back.  

He touched his face, marveling at the stardust tears. “Huh.”  

Outside, the event horizon rippled. Somewhere beyond, Order’s prison trembled.  

Lorain slid the heart back into her ribs. “Next time you martyr yourself? *Take me with you.*”  

Damien snorted, flicking a tear into the fryer where it became a diamond. “Martyrdom’s passé. Now—” He tossed her a spatula. “Flip the pancakes before they unionize.”  

She caught it, grip steady. The bar’s jukebox wheezed to life, playing *Cat’s in the Cradle* in a minor key.  

Somewhere between the Hydra’s dying screams and the syrup that tasted of forgiveness, Lorain understood:  

The greatest chaos wasn’t destruction.  

It was hope, stubborn and bright, burning in the dark.
