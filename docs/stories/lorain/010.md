# Eternal Damnation

The River Styx smelled like burnt popcorn.  

Lorain stepped off the soul-ferry into Hell’s seventh administrative circle, her boots sinking into carpet tiles stained with eternal ennui. Fluorescent lights flickered above cubicle walls that stretched into infinity, the air thick with the screech of demonic printers and the wails of middle management.  

"Name?" hissed a lizard-headed receptionist, claws clacking on a keyboard made of fingernails.  

"Lorain Morningstar Black."  

The demon paused. "*The* Lorain? Daughter of the Eternal Dickbag who crashed our Y2K rave?"  

She leaned over the desk, letting her tattoo peek out—the quantum strings over her heart humming with stolen chaos. "Got a meeting with Beezy."  

The demon’s tail burst into flames. "Lord Beelzebub is in a *budget meeting*—"  

"Tell him Daddy’s here to audit his ass."

Hell’s boardroom was exactly how Damien described during drunken rants: lava waterfalls, a minibar stocked with holy water contraband, and Beelzebub himself—a bloated corpse in a $6,000 suit—screaming into a conference call.  

"—no, Karen from Accounting, we can’t *outsource* damnation to the Philippines again—"  

Lorain cleared her throat.  

Beelzebub’s remaining eye twitched. "You."  

"Me." She tossed a burning scroll onto the table. "Damien’s canceling your lease."  

The room froze. A junior imp fainted.  

"*Cancel—?!*" Beelzebub’s wings shredded his Armani jacket. "This realm’s been ours since the Fall!"  

"Yeah, about that." Lorain pulled up a hologram of Hell’s original deed, Damien’s signature glowing with black hole ink. "Says here you’re subletting from the ‘Eternal King’s Summer Home for Wayward Souls.’" She smirked. "He wants the hot tub back."  

Demons hissed. The walls peeled back to reveal the true Hell beneath the corporate veneer—a festering wound where Damien had once stored his worst impulses: the ghost of disco, uncharged library books, every canceled Netflix show.  

Beelzebub lunged, rotors of bureaucracy spinning in his chest. "You think chaos scares us, half-breed? We *invented* red tape!"  

Lorain sighed. "Papa warned me you’d say that."  

She snapped her fingers.  

The fire alarms blared.  

Not just any alarms—Damien’s patented *End-Times™* mix: airhorn solos over Gregorian chants. The demons clutched their ears as the cubicle maze collapsed into primordial ooze.  

"You’re *evicted,*" Lorain shouted over the din, tossing a glowing key into the void. "Rent’s due in the 5th dimension."  

Beelzebub’s scream followed her out: "**TELL THAT DEADBEAT DAD OF YOURS WE’LL SEE HIM IN COURT!**"  

---  

Back at *The Event Horizon*, Damien toasted with a margarita the color of tax fraud. "How’d my little sparrow like Hell?"  

Lorain flopped onto a stool, her hair still smoking. "Your ‘summer home’ had a *dungeon* full of Furby souls."  

"Ah! 1998 was a wild year."  

She stole his drink. "You owe me a new spleen."  

His grin turned wicked. "Already replaced it. Check your left pocket."  

Lorain pulled out a snow globe containing a screaming Beelzebub.  

"Employee of the Month!" Damien crowed.  

Outside, the void rippled with infernal subpoenas. Lorain grinned.  

Same old Hell.  

Same old dad.
