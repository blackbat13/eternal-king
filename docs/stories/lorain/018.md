# Shape-shifting for Dummies


Xeroth’s idea of "instruction" involved a lot of sighing, eye-rolling, and passive-aggressive tail-flicking.  

**"First rule of shape-shifting"** he growled, currently a saber-toothed tiger with a Starbucks cup clutched in one paw. **"Don’t be *you*."**  

Lorain glared. "That’s not a rule. That’s a personality flaw."  

Damien, spectating from a hammock woven from black hole silk, tossed popcorn into the void. "Place your bets! I’ve got 20 souls on ‘Sparrow turns into a toaster.’"

**Lesson One: The Basics**  

Xeroth demonstrated, shifting seamlessly from tiger to falcon to sentient smoke. **"Your atoms are *suggestions*. Convince them otherwise."**  

Lorain focused. Her quantum tattoo flared.  

She turned into a raccoon.  

*Mostly.*  

"Why do I still have *hands*?!" she screeched, waving raccoon paws with human fingers.  

Xeroth facepalmed. **"You’re a crime against taxonomy."**

**Lesson Two: "Advanced" Techniques**  

**"Think of a form"** Xeroth droned, now a bored-looking cactus. **"Become it."**  

Lorain imagined a dragon.  

The result: a Komodo lizard with wings duct-taped to its back and a breath that smelled of burnt popcorn.  

Damien wheezed. "Is that… *tax fraud* incarnate?"  

Xeroth’s spines wilted. **"I quit."**  

---    

"*One more try!*" Lorain begged, her latest attempt leaving her as a sentient fog that kept yelling *"MIT rules!"* in Aramaic.  

Xeroth, now a very disappointed stapler, **"You’re worse than your father. And he once got stuck as a sock puppet for a decade."**  

Damien nodded. "*Worth it.*"

In a fit of desperation, Lorain tapped her quantum tattoo. "Screw subtlety."  

The shift started normally—scales, fangs, a respectable wingspan. Then her chaos kicked in.  

She became a *chaos dragon*: part eel, part disco ball, part existential crisis.  

"*Cool!*" Damien snapped selfies.  

Xeroth recoiled. **"You look like a lava lamp had a nervous breakdown."**  

The dragon hiccuped. The bar’s gravity turned polka-dotted.  

---  

Xeroth banned her from shape-shifting.  

"*Forever,*" he added, now a feral Roomba vacuuming up her chaos residue. **"You’re a walking OSHA violation."**  

Lorain, back to human(ish), smirked. "But I *nailed* the existential crisis part."  

Damien high-fived her. "That’s my girl! Wreck the laws of physics *first*, ask questions never."

The next day, Lorain found a self-help book on her pillow: *"Shape-Shifting for Dummies (Literally)"*—with Xeroth’s teeth marks on the cover.  

Parenting was hell.  

But chaotic apprenticeship?  

Apprenticeship came with hazard pay.
