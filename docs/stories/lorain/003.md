# Study Break

The cadaver blinked.  

Lorain’s scalpel clattered into the dissection tray as the medical school lab fluorescents flickered to the rhythm of the corpse’s newly beating heart. Across the stainless steel table, her lab partner Chad—pre-med, lacrosse captain, aggressively normal—froze mid-incision.  

"Dude" Chad whispered, his voice cracking. "Is your… your donor supposed to do that?"  

The cadaver sat up, formaldehyde dripping from its reanimated lungs. Lorain caught her reflection in its clouded eyes—black smoke curling from her nostrils, Damien’s telltale stardust flecking her irises.  

*Shit.*  

"College prank!" she blurted, slamming the corpse back onto the table with unnatural strength. "Hazing week! Go Terrapins!"  

Chad fainted gracefully into a biohazard bin.

Damien materialized in her dorm room that night wearing a "#1 Dad" hoodie that bled nightmare fractals. "Darling, if you wanted to play with corpses, you could’ve just asked." He tossed a mason jar onto her IKEA desk; inside, a miniature zombie prom danced to silent screams. "Your third spleen’s failing."  

Lorain choked on her ramen. "I’m *fine.*"  

"You’re leaking chaos radiation into the municipal water supply." He gestured to her goldfish bowl, where Nibbles now sported six eyes and a taste for human flesh. "Your endocrinology professor tried to diagnose you with ‘clinical divinity’ today. Adorable."  

The walls began to sweat black oil. Lorain’s stolen anatomy textbook levitated, pages rearranging themselves into the *Necronomicon: Collegiate Edition.*  

"No" she hissed, slamming it shut. "I’m *this close* to a recommendation letter from Dr. Gupta. No curses, no plagues, no—"  

A thunderclap shook the building. Outside, the campus clocktower morphed into a stone colossus that began reciting Sylvia Plath in reverse.  

Damien inspected his nails. "Your mother’s coven is petitioning the Academic Decay Committee to revoke your mortal status. Something about… ah yes." He snapped his fingers. A scroll appeared, written in menstrual blood and student loan contracts. *‘Plaintiff asserts the defendant constitutes an unregistered celestial weapon.’*  

Lorain’s left lung collapsed. She crumpled onto her beanbag chair, gasping as Damien crouched before her—king of entropy, weaver of flesh, maker of terrible parent-teacher conference apparitions.  

"They want to enroll you in the University of Perpetual Screams" he murmured, pressing a hand to her chest. Her ribs glowed through skin, revealing clockwork organs forged from dead stars. "Dreadful cafeteria. But!" His grin turned feral. "I’ve already forged transfer papers to Yale’s Department of Forbidden Knowledge."  

"No."  

"They have a Quidditch team."  

"*No cosmic meddling!*" She batted his hand away, coughing up nebula dust. "I just… I need to be normal. For one semester. Before—"  

The window shattered.  

Nine crows landed on her futon, each holding a scroll in their talons. The lead bird opened its beak to reveal her mother’s voice: *"You can’t hide behind chaos forever, little lie. The Ivy League won’t save you from matricide."*  

Damien sighed. "Well. There goes your security deposit."  

Lorain stared at the crows now building a nest from her psych notes. Somewhere on campus, the stone colossus began sobbing in iambic pentameter.  

"Fuck it." She grabbed the mason jar zombie prom. "Can you at least make my student loans sentient?"  

Damien’s laughter unspooled the laws of physics as he tossed her a pen that bled liquid paradox. "Welcome to adulthood, little sparrow. Now sign here to void your mortal soul—we’ll blame the interest rates on ‘extenuating eldritch circumstances.’"  

Outside, the stars began rearranging themselves into a giant "C+" for her astronomy midterm. Lorain grinned.  

It was going to be a hell of a semester.
