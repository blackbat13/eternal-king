# MIT

The particle accelerator hiccuped.  

Lorain stared at the quantum foam bubbling from MIT’s Alcatel-Lucent Lab equipment—a distinctly *non*-Newtonian fluid that was currently spelling "HAPPY GRADUATION, FAILURE" in Akkadian cuneiform.  

"Not. *Again.*" She kicked the cryostat, ignoring how her shadow peeled off the wall to flip her off.  

Across the lab, her research partner Raj—brilliant, mortal, tragically unaware of the apocalypse in his protein bar—adjusted his VR headset. "Dude, your dark matter calibration is *wild* today. You feeding the superconductors Adderall again?"  

Lorain’s phone buzzed. A text from *DAD❤️🔥*:  

**Thesis committee just sprouted second heads. FYI, Dean Nowicki’s is a succubus. Don’t make eye contact.**  

She typed back with a screwdriver: *U promised no tampering!*  

**Tampering? Darling, I merely enhanced their critical thinking skills. Literally.**  

A blood droplet fell onto her keyboard. Lorain swiped at her nose—black ichor now, ever since she’d jury-rigged her failing liver with black hole entropy filters.  

"Yo, L!" Raj tossed her a circuit board that hummed *Das Lied von der Erde*. "Wanna explain why our quantum fluctuations keep forming the face of that goth dude who stalks Parent’s Weekend?"  

The lab doors blew open.  

Nine women in power suits marched in, heels clicking through solid matter. The lead witch wore Dean Nowicki’s skin like an ill-fitting blazer, her true eyes burning through the borrowed cornea.  

"Ms. Black" the coven hissed through three mouths, "your *capstone project* on ‘Harnessing Cosmic Strings’ has been flagged for… plagiarism."  

Raj blinked. "Since when does MIT care about citing elder gods?"  

Lorain’s thumb found the panic button on her keychain—a gift from Damien that summoned either pizza or shoggoths. "Run."  

Too late.  

The coven raised manicured hands. The lab’s whiteboards erupted with equations that bled, each variable squirming into prophetic worms. Lorain’s vision doubled—her left eye seeing the mortal lab, her right witnessing the ritual chamber beneath MIT where her mother’s bones hung from the Infinite Corridor’s rafters.  

"We’ll be taking that thesis" the witches crooned, advancing as Raj screamed into a suddenly non-Euclidian trash can. "And the stolen chaos in your spleen."  

Lorain grabbed the nearest weapon—a prototype neutrino gun—and fired.  

Nothing happened.  

"*PAPA!*"  

The ceiling dissolved. Damien descended via chandelier made of screaming alumni, his tie knotted with the Geneva Convention. "Lorain Abigail Morningstar Black! Did you *seriously* weaponize subatomic particles without proper shielding?"  

"*Morningstar?*" Raj wheezed from inside a Klein bottle.  

The coven lunged. Damien sighed.  

"*Fine.* But you’re writing Harvard’s rejection letter." He snapped his fingers.  

Time split.  

In one reality, Lorain watched her thesis committee eat itself. In another, the neutrino gun belched forth a micro-singularity that swallowed three witches. In the third—  

"Focus, sparrow!" Damien tossed her a cheat sheet scribbled on event horizon parchment. "Your harmonic dampener’s phase variance is off by 0.0003 attoseconds!"  

Lorain ducked a flying Erlenmeyer flask. "I *told* you peer review was pointless!"  

"Children." The lead witch tore off Dean Nowicki’s face, revealing a black hole where her head should be. "Playtime’s over."  

The lab collapsed into the 4th dimension. Lorain’s borrowed organs screamed as the coven’s harvest began—a trillion microscopic hands plucking at Damien’s stardust stitches in her DNA.  

Raj materialized beside her, now part-cyborg from exposure to raw chaos. "Dude. Your family’s *fucked up.*"  

Damien grinned. "Adopted her from a dumpster!"  

Lorain grabbed both their hands. "The prototype! Raj—invert the Higgs field!"  

"But that’ll—"  

"*DO IT!*"  

Raj’s augmented fingers flew across keyboards that no longer obeyed physics. The neutrino gun whined. Damien’s eyes widened.  

"Oh you *clever* girl—"  

The blast tore through multiple realities.  

When the smoke cleared, Lorain stood alone in a perfect sphere of untouched lab equipment. The coven’s smoldering Prada heels circled her like Saturn’s rings. Her thesis glowed intact on the one surviving monitor: *Quantum Anarchy: A Framework for Ethical Chaos Distribution.*  

Damien clapped from the void. "Bravo! Now about that Nobel Prize—"  

Lorain collapsed.  

Her vision cleared to find Raj poking her with a pipette. "You… you weaponized paternal disappointment."  

"MIT’s secret ingredient." She spat out a molar that turned into a mayfly.  

Damien materialized holding a diploma written on Event Horizon parchment. "They’re offering you tenure in 2035. I negotiated!"  

The fire alarm rang. Somewhere in the multiverse, a dean’s second head was unionizing.  

Lorain grabbed her backpack—its interior now a pocket dimension full of Damien’s "care packages" (live volcanoes, sentient student loans).  

"One condition" she said, kicking open a portal to the registrar’s office. "No more ‘family reunions’ during finals week."  

Damien’s smile held supernovas. "But honey, where else would I display your childhood teeth collection?"  

Outside, the Charles River flowed backward. Lorain grinned.  

Commencement was going to be hell.
