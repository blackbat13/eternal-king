# Shopping Spree

The black hole mall’s security alarms were *screaming* in seven dead languages.  

Lorain gripped the interdimensional credit card Damien had forged from the Big Bang’s leftovers. "You said *one* store."  

Damien adjusted his sunglasses—literal eclipses—and tossed a supernova at the cashier. "Relax! Daddy’s got *coupons.*"

**First Stop: Event Horizon Couture**  

The mannequins were sentient and judgmental.  

"*Darling,*" hissed a dress made of dying stars, "your aura is *desperate.* Try our new black hole bodysuit—it hides existential dread *and* love handles!"  

Damien snapped his fingers. "Three in every color!"  

Lorain ducked a swarm of sentient sequins. "I’d rather wear OSHA violations."  

"*Too late!*" He tossed her a "shirt" that devoured light. "It’s *bonding,* sparrow!"

**Second Stop: Singularity Souvenirs**  

The shelves bent reality.  

"Ooh!" Damien held up snow globe containing a screaming Atlantis. "For your desk!"  

Lorain pointed to the label: *WARNING: CONTAINS ACTUAL CIVILIZATION*. "Hard pass."  

"Spoilsport." He bought it anyway, along with:  
- A cursed toaster that bred existential crises.  
- A self-aware fanny pack that insulted customers.  
- A "World’s Okayest Dad" mug that leaked dark matter.  

The cashier, a retired Time Cop, wept.

**Third Stop: Apocalypse Accessories**  

"*Finally,*" Lorain grabbed a belt that stabilized local physics. "Something useful."  

Damien gasped like she’d kicked a puppy. "*Practicality?* In *this* economy?" He replaced her cart with a sentient shopping bag that ate the belt. "Live a little!"  

The bag burped laws of thermodynamics.

**Fourth Stop: The Fitting Room of Alternate Realities**  

Lorain stepped into a booth labeled *WHAT IF YOU WERE NICE?*  

"*NOPE.*" She kicked the door, emerging as a version of herself wearing a pantsuit and *smiling*.  

Damien nearly dropped his anti-matter smoothie. "Kill it! *Kill it with fire!*"

**Checkout Lane 13**  

The clerk was a familiar face.  

"*You,*" Lorain and Order snarled in unison.  

Damien beamed. "Family discount?"  

Order’s register short-circuited. "Your ‘daughter’ owes 7,000 souls and a *library fine.*"  

Lorain slid the forged credit card. "Put the souls on Papa’s tab."  

The transaction birthed a minor apocalypse.

**Parking Lot (Black Hole #666)**  

Damien loaded their haul into a shopping cart made of dead gods. "Best. Day. *Ever.*"  

Lorain eyed the cart’s contents:  
- A chameleon that turned into your worst memory.  
- A lamp inhabited by the concept of buyer’s remorse.  
- A *Live, Laugh, Lava* sign that actually cried magma.  

"You’re banned from Father’s Day."  

He tossed her the keys to a newly purchased supernova. "Admit it. You had fun."  

The engine roared to life, singing *Born to Be Wild* in Aramaic.  

Lorain floored it through a wormhole. "You’re paying for therapy."  

"*Already did!*" He gestured to the backseat—a grinning Anubis holding a coupon for *1 Free Emotional Exorcism*.  

The void blurred past, strewn with their receipts and dying realities.
