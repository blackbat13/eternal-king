# First Universe

The instruction manual began with a trigger warning and a cocktail recipe.  

Lorain stared at the DIY Universe Kit™️ sitting on *The Event Horizon*’s bar—a glorified mason jar filled with screaming dark matter and a sticky note reading *DON’T PANIC (lol)* in Damien’s handwriting.  

"Papa, this is a war crime."  

Damien materialized upside-down above the black hole espresso machine, tossing her a screwdriver made of Schrödinger’s certainty. "Nonsense! Every growing godling needs their first cosmos. I birthed my debut supernova cluster at *half* your age."  

She poked the jar. The singularity inside hissed, manifesting a tiny "KICK ME" sign on its event horizon. "Why’s it sentient?"  

"*Flavor.*" He tossed her the manual, which bit her finger. "Step one: Ingest the chaos core. Step two: Vomit existential wonder. Step three: Profit!"  

Lorain flipped to the troubleshooting section. It just said *¯\_(ツ)_/¯* in Comic Sans.

The first attempt went as expected.  

"Why" Lorain wheezed, clutching the bathroom portal as her latest creation oozed into the void, "does my universe have *HOA bylaws?*"  

Damien inspected the remains—a smoldering globe of suburban dystopia where black holes mowed lawns. "Adorable! But needs more Krakens."  

"You sabotaged the dark matter seeds."  

"*Guided.*" He lobbed her another singularity. This one wore a tiny cowboy hat. "Try again. And maybe lay off the moral high ground—it’s clogging your creative pipes."

By attempt seven, Lorain had:  

1. Accidentally invented time taxes.  
2. Birthed a galaxy that exclusively produced Hallmark movie nebulas.  
3. Gotten sued by a sentient physics law for "copyright infringement."  

"*Focus,* sparrow." Damien doodled dicks on her event horizon blueprints. "Think *less* ‘utopia,’ more ‘sentient student loans.’"  

The eighth universe almost worked.  

It began in her palms—a delicate orb of chaotic potential, laws of physics scribbled in Damien’s favorite shade of anarchy-red. Stars sparked to life, singing off-key showtunes.  

Then the OSHA violations started.  

"Why" Lorain demanded as a black hole filed a workplace safety complaint, "do my quasars need healthcare?"  

Damien cackled, dodging a subpoena from her Big Bang. "You gave them *unions!*"  

---  

The breakthrough came at 3 a.m., fueled by spite and a stolen time loop.  

Lorain reshuffled the cosmic deck:  

- Gravity: Optional  
- Morality: A subscription service  
- All krakens required to wear party hats  

She sealed the jar with a burp of existential dread.  

Damien peered inside. "Cute. But where’s the *je ne sais quoi?*"  

"Here." She tossed in a scribbled Post-it: *BE KIND. OR ELSE.*  

The universe hiccuped. Stars formed a middle finger.  

"*Perfect.*" Damien’s grin held supernova pride. "Now release it into the wild!"  

---  

The bar’s regulars placed bets as Lorain unscrewed the lid.  

Her universe burst forth, promptly declaring war on the nearest dimension over a parking dispute.  

Damien wiped a tear. "They grow up so fast."  

Lorain watched her creation devour a lesser god’s tax haven. "It’s… kind of a dick."  

"*Your* dick." He toasted her with a margarita made of liquid irony. "Happy godhood, sparrow."  

Outside, the new universe mooned Heaven’s HR department.  

Somewhere beyond the void, Order screamed into a spreadsheet.
