# Too Soon?

The bartender angel exploded first.  

Lorain sighed as golden viscera dripped from *The Event Horizon*’s ceiling fan. "Really? During happy hour?"  

Outside her interdimensional bar, the Seventh Trumpet blared through nine layers of reality, shaking loose patrons who’d been hiding from eternity in her bathrooms. The Four Horsemen double-parked their apocalyptic steeds in the black hole lot, War and Famine arguing over valet tickets.  

"*Dad!*" she bellowed over the sound of collapsing heavens.  

Damien materialized mid-bite into a burrito the size of a neutron star. "Sparrow! You’ll *love* this—I taught Pestilence to play poker with his own plagues!"  

She grabbed his arm before he could vanish again. "Why is the Antichrist taking selfies in my VIP booth?"  

"Oh, that’s Jeff! Sweet kid, terrible at armageddon." He frowned at the ceiling where the Lamb’s Blood Fountain™️ was overflowing. "Wait. They started without me?"  

The ground split. Through the crack, Lorain glimpsed the Infinite Legion of Heaven’s HR Department clashing with Hell’s Unionized Damned in the parking lot.  

"Gabriel’s doing" she said, dodging a stray lightning bolt. "Said something about ‘end-times performance reviews.’"  

Damien’s eyes darkened to supernova black. "*Early.* They’re *decades* early."  

"Since when do you care about schedules?"  

He snapped his fingers. The bar’s jukebox swallowed a choir of seraphim mid-hallelujah. "Apocalypses need *pacing,* sparrow. You don’t rush the crescendo! Where’s the drama? The *panache?*"  

A comet crashed through the wall, revealing the Metatron reading last rites from an Excel spreadsheet. Lorain punted it into the void. "Fix. This."  

"Ugh, *fine.*" Damien tossed his burrito—now sentient and screaming—at the nearest horseman. "But you’re explaining to Death why we canceled his big number!"  

---  

The ceasefire began with a bar tab.  

Damien summoned both war councils to Table 9—sticky with the residue of a thousand forbidden deals. Gabriel’s halo clashed with Beelzebub’s tie as Damien slung his boots onto the Armageddon Button™️.  

"Kids, kids." He popped the seal on a Hellfire IPA. "You’re embarrassing yourselves."  

Gabriel’s sword hand twitched. "The Prophecies demand—"  

"The Prophecies *demand* a rewrite!" Damien tossed a dog-eared copy of Revelation into the Black Lake of Perpetual Meetings. "Seven seals? Seven *plagues?* You’re stuck in the cosmic dark ages!"  

Lorain slid tacos to a depressed Pestilence. "He’s been like this since Netflix canceled *Lucifer.*"  

Beelzebub belched sulfur. "We’ve got quotas, Morningstar! My damned souls need their mandatory torment hours!"  

"*Exactly.*" Damien’s grin turned feral. He snapped his fingers, replacing the apocalypse with PowerPoint slides. "Why end things when we can *monetize?*"  

The screen flickered:  

**APOCALYPSE 2.0**  
*– Subscription-Based Damnation*  
*– Eternal War DLC Packages*  
*– Soul NFTs*  

Gabriel’s wings molted. "This is sacrilege!"  

"This is *profit.*" Damien tossed Beelzebub a pitchfork shaped like a dollar sign. "Imagine: Armageddon as a service. Rapture loyalty points. *Plague-of-the-Month clubs!*"  

Lorain facepalmed. "You’re turning doomsday into a timeshare."  

"*Timeshares are evil,*" he corrected. "This is *capitalism.*"  

---  

The real fight started when Death pulled a scythe on the snack bar.  

"*Enough!*" His voice rattled quantum foundations. "I didn’t saddle Pale for this corporate drivel!"  

Damien sighed. "Always the edgelord." He turned to Lorain. "Sparrow? The button."  

She hesitated. "Which one?"  

"The *fun* one."  

Lorain groaned, reaching under the bar to smash the **EMERGENCY RESET** hammered together after the Yale Forbidden Knowledge incident.  

The universe hiccuped.  

Angels mid-smite became confused toucans. Demons morphed into feral scooters. The Lamb’s Blood Fountain™️ now dispensed artisanal kombucha.  

Damien grabbed the mic as reality rebooted. "Apocalypse postponed! Catch the reruns on Purgatory+!"  

Gabriel, now a disheveled flamingo, pecked angrily at his contract. Beelzebub’s scooter form ran over the Antichrist.  

Lorain surveyed the carnage. "They’ll try again."  

"Obviously." Damien stole her taco. "But now they’re stuck in licensing hell."  

Outside, the Four Horsemen rode off into a sponsored sunset, Pestilence sneezing glitter.  

"Happy?" she asked.  

He ruffled her hair, fingers trailing supernova sparks. "Next time, we’ll add a musical number."  

The jukebox wheezed to life, playing *It’s the End of the World* as elevator muzak.
