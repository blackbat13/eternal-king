# Sweet Sixteen

The air in Damien’s throne room shimmered like molten gold as Lorain burst through the double doors, her boots tracking autumn leaves from the mortal realm onto polished obsidian floors. "Papa! The maple trees in New Hampshire are *on fire* with color this year—you’d hate it." 

Damien didn’t look up from the spinning constellation he cradled in his palm, its dying stars bleeding violet light through his fingers. "Your mortal fixation on *seasonal aesthetics* remains baffling," he drawled, snapping his fist shut. The constellation collapsed into a black hole that sucked the chamber’s shadows into a screaming vortex before he swallowed it whole. "But yes. Red is vulgar."

Lorain flopped onto the steps of his dais, her rainbow-knit sweater clashing horribly with the throne’s writhing shadow-flesh. "Can we at least keep the pumpkin spice portal open? Mrs. O’Hara at the bakery gave me free scones again." She held up a pastry bag oozing cinnamon stardust. "I told her my dad works in ‘interdimensional logistics.’"

"Ah yes," Damien purred, his crown of fractured timelines tilting as he leaned forward. "The same woman who asked if I’d consider ‘haunting her bedroom’ during last Samhain’s séance." His chuckle made the castle’s gargoyles blush. "Shall I arrange another carriage ride through supernova debris for your birthday, or has the mortal obsession with ‘sweet sixteen’ parties finally—"

The chamber trembled. Lorain’s half-eaten scone froze mid-crumb as every mirror in the castle turned blood-red. Damien’s smile died. 

"**They’re early,**" he muttered, the walls peeling back to reveal a thousand screaming galaxies. 

Lorain didn’t flinch. "The Celestial Accord enforcers again? I told you vaporizing their ambassador was a bad—"

"Not them." Damien’s human guise flickered—for one heartbeat, Lorain saw the thing beneath; eyes like collapsing universes, skin etched with the screams of forgotten gods. "Your mother’s coven. They’ve finally tracked the bloodline." 

The pastry bag slipped from her fingers. "My... *real* mother?" 

Damien’s sigh unraveled the edges of reality. "Oh darling. You didn’t think a mortal babe abandoned in a Brooklyn alleyway could survive seventeen years in my care without... *modifications*, did you?" He snapped his fingers. The castle dissolved into a suburban living room stuck in perpetual 1999—wood paneling, bowl-cut Jesus paintings, the stench of desperation and potpourri. 

On the coffee table between them, a VHS tape labeled *Loraine’s 1st Birthday!* began playing static. 

"Your third set of lungs is failing," Damien said gently as cathode rays painted his face blue. "The witches aren’t coming to kill you, little sparrow. They’re coming to harvest what I wove into your bones to keep you breathing." 

Outside the fake windows, something with too many teeth pressed against the veil. Lorain stared at her trembling hands—*human* hands, always stubbornly human, even when the physics of Damien’s realm tried to warp her. 

"You made me a Trojan horse," she whispered. 

"**I made you alive.**" For the first time in centuries, the Eternal King’s voice cracked. "Now. Will you help me trap a goddess in a snow globe, or shall we continue this tedious melodrama until—"

Lorain threw a couch cushion at his head. It burst into ravens halfway. 

"Teach me the supernova carriage trick first," she demanded, eyes glinting with borrowed chaos. "And *stop* trying to parent-trap me with Mrs. O’Hara!" 

Somewhere beyond the collapsing dimensions, ancient witches began to scream. Damien’s laughter shook dying stars from the ceiling as the castle reassembled itself around them—one room now conspicuously resembling a Hot Topic.
