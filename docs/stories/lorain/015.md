# Matchmaking

The first suitor arrived via exploding bouquet.  

Lorain stared at the crater where her favorite stool used to be, now occupied by a vampire prince holding roses dipped in liquid moonlight. "M’lady" he purred, fangs glinting with *just* the right amount of danger. "Your father suggested we… *mingle.*"  

"*Papa!*" Lorain bellowed, tossing a holy water grenade over her shoulder.  

Damien materialized in the jukebox, grinning around a mouthful of popcorn. "You like him? I made his brooding posture *extra* angsty!"  

The vampire lunged. Lorain sidestepped, letting him impale himself on a taxidermied kraken. "Next."  

---  

Suitors #2 through #5 included:  
- A demigod whose abs literally sparkled ("He’s biodegradable!" Damien insisted).  
- An AI programmed to recite love sonnets in iambic *YEET*ameter.  
- A sentient black hole who "just wants to consume you… *romantically.*"  
- Order’s estranged nephew, Chadwick the Accountant.  

Lorain vaporized them all with increasing creativity.  

"You’re being *picky,*" Damien whined, dodging her plasma wrench. "Love’s a battlefield, sparrow!"  

"*You’re* a battlefield." She kicked open the VIP portal labeled *ABSOLUTELY NOT BOYFRIENDS*. "Stop. Now."

Suitor #6 was different.  

He arrived quietly—no explosions, no poetry, no visible weapons. Just a man in a leather jacket leaning against the bar, nursing a beer that *didn’t* scream when sipped.  

"Lorain" he said, and her quantum tattoo *hummed*.  

Damien froze mid-prank call to Hades. "Oh. *Him.*"  

The man smirked. His eyes held supernova remnants. "Damien."  

Lorain’s wrench clattered. "You… know each other?"  

Damien’s grin turned razor-edged. "Sparrow, meet Prometheus. We go way back. *Firestarter* here owes me twelve apocalypses."  

Prometheus rolled his eyes. "You blew up my liver in 3021 BC."  

"*Allegedly.*"  

Lorain looked between them. "Let me guess—he’s your ‘I’ll set you up with my worst enemy’ pick?"  

Damien tossed her a winking emoji grenade. "More like ‘I’ll set you up with someone who can *keep up.*’"  

Prometheus caught the grenade mid-detonation, its explosion becoming a shower of non-toxic glitter. "Cute. Still compensating, Damien?"  

The bar’s gravity failed. Lorain’s hair floated as the two gods squared off, chaos and defiance crackling between them.  

"*Enough.*" She slammed her palms on the counter, activating the emergency black hole protocol. "Out. *Both of you.*"

Later, Damien found her scrubbing scorch marks off the event horizon tap.  

"Jealousy’s unbecoming, sparrow."  

She threw a rag at him. "You’re *unbecoming.*"  

He caught it, smile softening. "He’d have said yes, you know. To you."  

Lorain’s tattoo pulsed. "Not interested."  

"Liar."  

"*Hypocrite.*" She jabbed a finger at his chest. "When’s the last time *you* let someone close?"  

Damien’s laugh shook loose stardust. "Chaos is my one true love."  

"Chaos is your *excuse.*"  

They stared at each other—king and creation, both too stubborn to bend.  

Finally, Damien sighed. "Fine. No more suitors."  

"Promise?"  

He crossed his hearts. "Scout’s honor."

The next morning, Lorain opened the bar to find a *very* confused Cupid chained to the dartboard.  

"*PAPA.*"  

Damien’s cackle echoed through the void.
