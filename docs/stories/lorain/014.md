# Till Death Do Us Part

The zombie ordered a Cosmo.  

Lorain stared at the reanimated corpse slumped at her bar, its mossy fingers leaving grave-soil smudges on her freshly polished counter. Behind it, the necromancer—a twitchy grad student wearing a *I ♥ Cthulhu* hoodie—hiccuped over his fourth Lazarus Lager.  

"S’not working" he slurred, gesturing to the zombie currently trying to lick its own eyeball. "Made ‘er perfect! Used all the… the…" He belched graveyard rot. "*Standards.*"  

Lorain snatched the cocktail shaker before the zombie could drink it. "You spelled your ex back from the dead. Congrats. Now get it out of my bar."  

"*Her,*" the necromancer wailed. "She’s just… cold!"  

The zombie moaned, dropping its eyeball into the tip jar.  

Lorain massaged her quantum tattoo. "Let me guess—ghosted you, so you ghosted her harder?"  

He nodded, tears dissolving his eyeliner. "How do I make her love me again?"  

Damien materialized in the zombie’s lap. "*Easy!*" He tossed the necromancer a cursed matchbook. "Step one: Arson. Step two: Deniability. Step three: *Profit!*"  

Lorain kicked him off the stool. "Ignore him. Here’s your love tip: *Stop resurrecting exes.*"  

The necromancer blinked. "But the spells—"  

"Are bandaids on bullet wounds." She slid him a Black Hole IPA. "Real love’s messy. Doesn’t come with a reanimation warranty."  

Damien fake-swooned. "My little romantic! Next you’ll host speed dating with eldritch horrors."  

The zombie grabbed the necromancer’s face, smooshing his cheeks. "*Brrrrraaaaains,*" it moaned, almost tenderly.  

"See?" Lorain gestured with a bleach rag. "She’s trying."  

"But she’s not *her!*"  

"*Because you’re not you!*" Lorain’s tattoo flared, quantum strings unraveling. "You want love? Stop digging up the past and *live* with the rot."  

The necromancer froze. So did the zombie. Even Damien paused mid-eye-roll.  

"...That was almost wise" he muttered.  

"Shut up."  

The necromancer stood, swaying. "I’ll… I’ll try." He snapped his fingers; the zombie collapsed into a bouquet of black roses. "Keep the tip."  

Damien inspected the flowers. "These are cursed."  

"Obviously." Lorain stuffed them into a beer stein. "But the kid’s got potential."  

"To end up in our dumpster?"  

"To *try.*"  

Outside, the necromancer tripped into a portal labeled *THERAPY OR BUST*.  

Damien stole a rose. "Still soft, sparrow."  

She kicked him into the event horizon. "Still a pest, *papa.*"
