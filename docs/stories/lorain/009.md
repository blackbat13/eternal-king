# Fatherly Love

The black hole stopped singing.  

Lorain froze, mid-swipe of the bar’s counter, as the sudden silence rang louder than any apocalypse. Behind her, Damien stood unnaturally still—no quip about the dishes, no snap about her mortal sentimentality. Just the faint *drip-drip* of his crown dissolving into liquid paradox onto the floor.  

“Papa?”  

He didn’t move. The wound in his chest—the one Order had carved eons ago and Lorain had stitched with quantum strings—gaped openly, spilling not blood but *memories*:  

*A colicky infant screaming as Damien panickedly summoned supernovas to soothe her.*  
*Him bartering with Death itself when she caught mortal flu at seven.*  
*Midnight feedings with nebula milk, his hands trembling at her fragility.*  

Lorain reached for him. “Your wound’s—”  

“**I love you.**”  

The words hit like a dying star.  

Not poetic. Not wrapped in metaphor. Raw and simple, scalding the air between them.  

The jukebox short-circuited. A patron’s beer turned to ash. Lorain’s tattoo *sizzled* where Damien’s chaos met her shock.  

“You’re… malfunctioning,” she managed.  

He laughed—a broken, human sound. “Aren’t we all?”  

The admission hung like a guillotine. Lorain saw it now—the careful calculus behind every lesson, every prank. The way he’d built her into something unbreakable because the alternative was unbearable.  

“Since when?” Her voice cracked.  

Damien flicked a finger. The memory pool at their feet showed her first steps—not toward him, but a glowing rift. His hand outstretched, not to catch, but to let her fall. *To choose chaos.*  

“Since you crawled toward entropy like it was home.”  

The wound in his chest deepened, spilling older truths:  

*Him pleading with Order to spare Lorain during the Harvest Wars.*  
*Burning galaxies to buy her mortal college years.*  
*Weeping in the void when her third heart failed.*  

Lorain stepped into the memory flood. “You never…”  

“*Couldn’t.*” His human guise crumbled fully now, revealing the boy-king of dead stars beneath. “Love’s a weakness. A weapon. I swore after the first betrayal, I’d never—”  

She kissed his cheek.  

The bar imploded.  

Not from chaos, but from the sheer impossibility of the gesture. When reality reformed, they sat on the floor amid the ruins of Damien’s crown, Lorain’s head against his ribs where the wound now pulsed gold.  

“Say it again,” she demanded.  

“The Andromeda Plague was my fault.”  

“*Papa.*”  

He sighed, the sound unraveling three minor dimensions. “I love you, you insufferable sparrow. Happy?”  

Outside, the event horizon burst into fireworks shaped like middle fingers.  

Lorain stole a shard of his broken crown. “Nope. Gonna need that in writing. With notarized stardust.”  

His laughter shook loose comets from the rafters.  

Somewhere beyond the veil, Order’s prison rattled with the aftershocks.  

Damien snapped his fingers. The bar reassembled—chairs now uncomfortably shaped like hearts. “Don’t get used to this.”  

“Wouldn’t dream of it.”  

But as Lorain returned to polishing glasses that now bore tiny carvings of *K͜҉̛a̸̸i̶r̵o̸s̶̴̵ + Sparrow*, she let herself smile.  

Chaos had always been his love language.  

This?  

This was just translation.
