# Enough with the Witches

The jukebox ate another soul.  

Lorain wiped the counter of her interdimensional dive bar, *The Event Horizon*, as a regular—a time-displaced prohibition agent with a tentacle mustache—wept into his Old Fashioned. "They’re g-g-gonna repo my DeLorean" he hiccuped, ectoplasm dripping from his trilby.  

She opened her mouth to respond when nine familiar shadows darkened the black hole entrance.  

"We’re closed" Lorain said without turning, pouring vodka that screamed in Cyrillic.  

The coven materialized atop her barstools, their designer power suits now threaded with Lorain’s stolen baby teeth. The leader snapped a manicured finger; the lights died, replaced by projections of Lorain’s first breath—a Brooklyn alleyway, Damien’s shadow catching her falling form.  

"Sweetheart" the witches crooned, "you didn’t RSVP to the family reunion."  

Lorain’s grip tightened on the rag. Seventeen years of failed harvests. Thirty-eight replaced organs. Two hundred and six bones reforged with Damien’s chaos. Her reflection in the backbar mirror showed cracks—faint starbursts around her eyes where mortality had finally chipped away.  

"Last warning" she said.  

The leader laughed, summoning a scroll that reeked of amniotic fluid and tax audits. "By blood and betrayal, we claim—"  

Lorain smashed a bottle over the scroll.  

The coven blinked.  

"You know what MIT’s quantum anarchy program *really* teaches?" She pressed the jagged neck to the witch’s throat. "How to weaponize tenure."  

The bar exploded.  

Patrons dove for cover as Lorain’s trap activated—the floorboards she’d carved with her thesis equations flaring to life. The coven shrieked, their Louboutins welding to event horizon equations.  

"Cute" the leader spat, dissolving into a swarm of IRS audit notices. "But we’ve been binding fools since Salem!"  

Lorain ducked as cursed W-2 forms rained down. "Damien! You better be recording this for my parenting podcast!"  

A familiar chuckle echoed from the men’s room. "Darling, I’m your *silent partner!*"  

She rolled her eyes. Of course he’d stick to the bit.  

The coven reconstituted, now thirty feet tall and wearing Lorain’s stolen childhood memories like war paint. "Enough games, cuckoo. Time to gut the nest."  

Lorain sighed. She’d hoped to avoid this.  

Unbuttoning her flannel, she revealed the tattoo over her heart—Damien’s 18th birthday "gift" a living mandala of quantum strings. "You want what he put in me?" She pressed a palm to the design. "Let’s see if your cholesterol can handle it."  

The tattoo *unfolded*.  

Reality stuttered. The bar became a Klein bottle, the coven trapped in the recursive curve as Lorain’s voice echoed through dimensions:  

"Hypothesis: You can’t harvest what’s already decaying."  

Her hands plunged into her own chest.  

The coven screamed as she ripped out Damien’s final gift—the dying black hole he’d sutured into her sternum after Yale’s Forbidden Knowledge finals.  

"Observe" Lorain rasped, event horizon winds tearing her skin to stardust, "the inevitable collapse of toxic motherhood."  

She hurled the singularity.  

The coven imploded.  

For three heartbeats, *The Event Horizon* held its breath. Then the jukebox coughed up nine pristine leather handbags.  

Lorain collapsed against the bar, her chest a kaleidoscope of healing spacetime. Damien materialized beside her, tossing salt over his shoulder into a screaming portal.  

"Brava!" He kicked a Fendi under the counter. "Though technically, you’ve orphaned yourself."  

She stared at the fading cracks in her skin. "They were never my family."  

Damien stilled.  

Outside, the void between dimensions rippled—not with threats, but with something like respect.  

"My little sparrow" he murmured, summoning a mop for the cosmic gore, "you haven’t needed one for decades."  

The jukebox resurrected itself, playing *We Are Family* in a phrygian dominant scale. Lorain snorted, kicking open a wormhole to the IRS’s infernal branch.  

"Cleanup’s your shift" she said, stealing his jacket of living shadows. "I’ve got a podcast to edit."  

Damien’s laughter followed her into the paradox parking lot—where nine new motorcycles, forged from coven hubris, awaited with purring engines.  

Lorain revved the throttle.  

Retirement was overrated anyway.
