# The Many Deaths of Lorain

The black hole grenade looked *cute* in her palm—a glossy obsidian sphere Damien had gifted her "for light pest control." Lorain should’ve known better.  

"Don’t" Xeroth warned, his current form a disgruntled armadillo with a PhD in side-eye. **"That’s a Type-7 singularity. Even *I* wouldn’t juggle it."**  

She tossed it anyway. "Relax. Papa made it *childproof*—"  

The grenade hiccuped.  

Then the bar inverted.

**Death #1:**  

The last thing Lorain saw:  
1. Xeroth flipping her off with six claws.  
2. The grenade manifesting a tiny "Oops" flag.  
3. Her quantum tattoo screaming in ultraviolet.  

Then—*nothing*.  

Not darkness. Not void. *Nothing.*  

---  

She woke up on the bar’s ceiling, which was now the floor, her mouth full of ash and Damien’s laughter.  

"Welcome back!" He toasted her with a margarita garnished with her still-smoking shoelace. "First death’s always the weirdest. Pro tip: don’t inhale the void spiders."  

Lorain spat out a tooth that immediately grew legs and skittered away. "*What. The. Hell.*"  

"*Correction:*" Xeroth clambered down from a chandelier, now a singed possum. **"*When* the hell. You’ve been dead for… checks watch… three eternities. Also, you owe me a new tail."**  

Damien tossed her a mirror. Her reflection showed cracks of starlight under her skin, eyes flickering between dimensions. "Chaos puberty! Cute, right?"  

She punched him. Her fist phased through his chest, dislodging a trapped scream from the Cretaceous period.  

"*Focus,* sparrow." He flicked her forehead, solid again. "First rule of dying: the meat suit’s a little *glitchy* post-respawn."

**The Aftermath:**  

1. **The bar’s gravity developed trust issues.**  
2. **Her MIT hoodie now screamed in Aramaic.**  
3. **Xeroth kept leaving obituaries on her pillow.**  
*("Here lies Lorain. She lived as she died: annoyingly.")*  

"When does it stop feeling like I’m made of static?" she growled, scrubbing ectoplasm off the soul ledger.  

Damien shrugged, defacing a holy scripture with doodles of his own face. "After death thirteen, you’ll barely notice! Except the phantom limbs. Those stick around."  

She stared at her flickering hands. "*Why* didn’t you warn me?"  

"Where’s the fun in that?"

**Death #2 (Later That Tuesday):**  

A rogue karma debt manifested as a platypus with a grudge.  

"*Seriously?*" Lorain sighed as it launched itself at her jugular.  

Xeroth yawned. **"Told you to balance your karmic spreadsheet."**  

Damien took a selfie with her corpse.

**Death #7 (Approximately):**  

By the time the sentient tax audit strangled her with red tape, the routine was familiar:  

1. **Die dramatically.**  
2. **Float in the *nothing*.**  
3. **Wake up to Damien’s terrible jokes.**  

"You’re getting faster!" He applauded as she reformed, this time with optional gills. "Personal best: 12 seconds dead!"  

Lorain projectile-vomited dark matter. "*Hate you.*"  

"*Hate’s* a strong word. I prefer ‘eternally mildly inconvenienced.’"  

---  

**Death #13 (The Big One):**  

The Voids came for payback. Lorain charged headfirst, because *screw subtlety*.  

The last thing she heard:  
- Damien’s shout: "*Sparrow, wait—*"  
- Xeroth’s sigh: **"Here we go again."**  

The *nothing* felt different this time—warmer, like a held breath.  

She woke up *pissed*.  

"Told you you’d get used to it" Damien said, uncharacteristically not-smirking.  

She grabbed his collar. "*Never* do that again."  

"Which part? The dying? The Voids? The—"  

"The *caring*."  

He blinked. Then grinned. "No promises."
