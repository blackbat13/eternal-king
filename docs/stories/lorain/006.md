# Retirement

The faculty meeting was going splendidly until Lorain’s pancreas exploded.  

She stared at the eldritch viscera now dripping from the projector screen onto Dean Whitmore’s toupee. Her tenure-track colleagues murmured—not about the pulsating organ, but about the *"unorthodox teaching methods"* she’d used to explain dark energy via interpretive dance.  

"Professor Black" the dean said, peeling a tentacle from his coffee mug, "your student evaluations mention…" He squinted at the report. "*‘Doesn’t age. Eyes sometimes black holes. Saved my soul from midterms.’* Care to comment?"  

Lorain’s phone buzzed. A text from *DAD❤️🔥* lit up her Apple Watch:  

**Pro tip: Eat the weakest committee member first. Builds credibility!**  

She kicked her briefcase shut on the still-squirming pancreas. "Tenure denial noted. If you’ll excuse me—"  

The emergency exit led not to the parking lot, but to Damien’s throne room. He lounged atop a desk made of crystallized screams, grading papers with a quill that wept acid. "*There* you are. Your endocrine system’s staging a coup."  

Lorain collapsed into an armchair that tried to psychoanalyze her. "I told you to stop replacing my organs with cosmic horrors."  

"Darling, you stopped *aging.*" He tossed her a MRI scan where her bones glowed with forbidden runes. "Mortality’s like a chain restaurant—eventually, the franchise fails."  

Outside the void windows, her real apartment burned. The coven’s latest gift—a plague of truth-telling locusts—swarmed Cambridge chanting *"Fatherless abomination!"*  

Damien snapped his fingers. A PowerPoint appeared: *Lorain’s Immortality Options!*  

"Choice A: Full ascension! You’d make a delightful minor deity of academic sabotage."  

"B: I carve the chaos from your marrow. You die mid-lecture, tragically human."  

"Or C—" He grinned. "We weaponize your tenure denial into a nice little reality war."  

Lorain’s watch chimed. A student email: *‘Prof B—pls extend paper deadline. My dog ate my draft & also became an oracle.’*  

The walls melted into her campus office. Her framed diplomas rattled—Yale’s Forbidden Knowledge degree hissed at MIT’s Quantum Anarchy certificate.  

"*Why now?*" She pressed a hand to her chest where twin neutron stars now served as lymph nodes. "I was fine at thirty. Thirty-two. Then—"  

"Ah." Damien’s smile dimmed. He nodded to the window where three ravens circled—each holding a slice of birthday cake from decades she hadn’t aged. "Your mother’s coven has been… busy. Their curses accelerated the decay."  

A knock. The door dissolved to reveal nine women wearing her face and Supreme Court robes.  

"Lorain Abigail Morningstar Black" the coven intoned through tenure denial letters, "you stand accused of existing."  

Damien sighed. "Dreadful timing. I’ve got parent-teacher conferences at the Supernova Daycare."  

The lead witch conjured a gavel made of Lorain’s stolen baby teeth. "The mortal coil rejects you. Time to—"  

Lorain exploded.  

Not metaphorically.  

Her skin sloughed off in equations, muscles unwinding into celestial strings that strangled the courtroom lights. The coven shrieked as her bones sang a dirge in the key of entropy.  

"*Enough.*" Her voice tore holes in causality. "I’ll choose D."  

Damien paused mid-snack—he’d been eating the jury box. "D?"  

Lorain’s reforming hand gripped a whiteboard marker. She wrote on reality itself:  

*1. Keep the chaos*  
*2. Ditch the tenure track*  
*3. Open interdimensional bar*  
*4. Charge coven for emotional damages*  

The universe paused.  

Then Damien threw back his head and laughed until black holes formed in his tears. "Oh sparrow. They’ll write *sonnets* about your midlife crisis."  

Outside, the locusts began chanting *"Last call!"* in ancient Aramaic. Lorain grabbed a witch by her subpoena and hoisted her onto the bar.  

"First round’s on the house" she said, mixing dark matter with cheap tequila. "And someone get Dean Shithead a Shirley Temple."  

Somewhere beyond the veil, her pancreas started a cover band.  

It was going to be one hell of a retirement.
