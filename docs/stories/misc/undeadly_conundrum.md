# (Un)deadly Conundrum

The air over the city of Vorthas hung thick with the stench of rot and burnt bone. Once a jewel of the southern kingdoms, its white towers now stood cracked and blackened, draped in veils of necrotic mist. The streets crawled with the dead—shambling, hollow-eyed, mouths whispering forgotten prayers. At the heart of the ruin, atop the shattered spire of the Grand Cathedral, the necromancer Malak Vorth—last scion of the city’s fallen royal line—wove his final spell, summoning the Hollow Choir, an army of souls bound in fleshless agony.

And somewhere in the rubble below, two figures lurched through the filth.

One was a woman with silver eyes, dragging a left arm that dangled by a thread of blackened sinew. Her steps were uneven, her jaw unhinged with a wet *click* every few paces. The other was a shambling mound of mismatched corpses—three torsos stacked like a grotesque totem, one head drooling onto the shoulder of another, the third blinking rapidly with too many eyes. A crow’s wing twitched from its ribcage. It was, objectively, the most convincing zombie in the city.

Xeroth, currently in his "artistic interpretation of a necrotic amalgam" form, let out a gurgle that might’ve been laughter. *"Perfect. Vera, darling, you’re selling it. That arm fall? Oscar-worthy. Truly, the Academy of the Undead would weep."*

Vera Zharkova shot him a glare through one milky, half-rotted eye. She reached down, grabbed her arm by the wrist, and *slammed* it back into the socket with a sickening *pop*. "If I wanted to play dress-up with corpses," she hissed, voice rasping like a blade on stone, "I would’ve stayed in the Bratva."

*"Oh, come now,"* Xeroth gurgled, shifting one of his heads to whisper conspiratorially. *"You know Damien loves a good prank. And this? This is *art*. Besides, you’re not *actually* rotting. Just… temporarily undead-adjacent. Think of it as method observation."*

Vera grunted. "Method *insanity*."

They moved through the ruins, passing ranks of mindless dead, listening, watching. The necromancer’s power was immense—too immense. The air crackled with stolen life, the ground pulsed like a dying heart. But there was a flaw. A tremor in the magic. The kind that comes when a mortal tries to wear a god’s skin.

*"He’s burning through his own soul,"* Xeroth murmured, one of his heads peeling back its lipless mouth in a grin. *"Classic necromancer problem. They think death is a tool. It’s not. Death is a *dog*. And Malak Vorth? He’s not holding the leash. The dog’s eating his fingers."*

Vera nodded, her jaw clicking. "Then we wait. Let him collapse. No need to waste moy tsar’s time."

*"Ah, but where’s the fun in that?"* Xeroth shifted again—this time into a single, emaciated figure in tattered priest’s robes, face sunken, eyes glowing faintly violet. *"What if we… *help* him fall? Just a little nudge. A whisper in the dark. A misplaced rune. Damien *did* say to determine if he’d collapse on his own. He didn’t say we couldn’t… *encourage* the process."*

Vera narrowed her eyes. "You’re going to get us flayed by the King if this goes wrong."

*"Nonsense. Damien *adores* creative solutions. And besides,"* Xeroth grinned, revealing rows of needle-like teeth that hadn’t been there a moment before, *"if we die, we’re already zombies. What’s one more time?"*

Above them, the Hollow Choir began to sing—a sound like glass breaking in a tomb. The spire trembled.

And deep in the castle between dimensions, Damien, sipping tea with Lorain in her bar, suddenly sneezed.

Lorain looked up, wings twitching. "You didn’t."

Damien smiled, innocent as a storm before it drowns a continent. "I have *no* idea what you’re talking about, Sparrow."

Xeroth, now whispering forbidden syllables into the ear of a dead acolyte, would’ve grinned wider if he could.

The necromancer was about to learn a very important lesson.

Chaos doesn’t raise the dead.

It *plays* with them.

---

The moment Xeroth whispered those forbidden syllables into the dead acolyte’s ear, the necromancer’s magic *caught*. Not collapsed—it *ignited*. Malak Vorth’s Hollow Choir didn’t falter; it *swelled*, voices rising to a shriek that cracked the cathedral spire like dry clay. The necromancer’s eyes blazed with stolen starlight, his skeletal fingers weaving runes of pure entropy. He’d tasted the Chaos in Xeroth’s meddling—and *liked* it. Now, instead of crumbling, he was *ascending*, his power surging as he siphoned the unstable energy Xeroth had carelessly injected into the ritual.  

*"Oh, splendid,"* Xeroth gurgled, his three-headed form shuddering as a wave of necrotic force slammed into them. Vera’s reattached arm tore clean off again, skittering across the cobblestones. *"Turns out necromancers *do* appreciate unsolicited creative input. Who knew?"*  

Vera didn’t answer. She was already dragging Xeroth—now a lopsided pile of twitching limbs—into the shadow of a collapsed archway as the streets erupted. The dead weren’t shambling anymore. They were *marching*. In perfect, terrifying unison. Toward *them*.  

---  

Deep in the castle between dimensions, Damien didn’t sigh. He *glowed*. A low, dangerous pulse of crimson light rippled from his throne as he felt the backlash of Xeroth’s "nudge" curdle into catastrophe. Lorain dropped her cocktail shaker, wings flaring wide.  

"You *let* him do that on purpose," she accused, hands on her hips. "You *knew* he’d miscalculate!"  

Damien sipped his tea, utterly serene. "I knew *Xeroth* would miscalculate. I didn’t know Malak Vorth would have the audacity to *repurpose Chaos magic*. Fascinating." He set down the cup. "Time for Nyx."  

---  

Nyx didn’t arrive with a bang. She arrived with *silence*.  

One moment, the necromancer stood atop the shattered spire, arms raised as the Hollow Choir’s shriek reached a fever pitch. The next, a figure materialized from the swirling necrotic mist—a woman carved from moonlight and shadow. Her gown was the deep black of a starless void, clinging to curves that moved with predatory grace. Her skin was pale as bone, but her eyes… her eyes were *alive*. Not with stolen life, but with something older, wilder. *Chaos*.  

Malak Vorth froze. His breath hitched.  

"Who—?" he rasped, power faltering for the first time.  

Nyx smiled. Slow. Deadly. She glided toward him, bare feet leaving no trace on the broken stone. "They call me Nyx," she purred, her voice like velvet over broken glass. "The night has been… *lonely*." She reached out, a single finger tracing the air near his cheek. "You play with death so boldly. But do you truly *understand* it?"  

The necromancer’s arrogance melted into rapt fascination. He’d spent centuries forcing the dead to obey, but *this*… this was something new. Something *free*. Untamed. She wasn’t a slave to the grave. She *was* the grave—and she *chose* to walk.  

"You’re… different," he breathed, stepping closer, entranced. "Not bound. Not *broken*."  

"Death broke me once," Nyx murmured, leaning in until her lips nearly brushed his ear. "But *he* remade me." She didn’t name Damien. She didn’t need to. The raw, ancient power radiating from her was signature enough. "Imagine… *your* power, unchained. Not *stealing* life… but *commanding* the void between."  

Malak Vorth’s eyes widened. He saw it—*felt* it—a vision Nyx wove with her voice: not an army of mindless dead, but legions of *willing* shadows, dancing to his will. True immortality. True dominion. His hands trembled, not with exhaustion, but with *greed*.  

"It’s… possible?" he whispered, utterly ensnared.  

Nyx’s smile deepened. "Only if you let *me* show you." She pressed a hand to his chest. Not to stop his heart—he had none left—but to *feel* the hollow where it should be. "Let go of the choir, Malak. Let go of the *weakness* of stolen souls. Embrace the *silence*…"  

And he did.  

The Hollow Choir’s shriek cut off mid-note. The marching dead froze. The necromancer’s stolen starlight flickered, then *imploded* inward, drawn into the void Nyx offered. He swayed, drunk on the promise of power greater than death itself.  

---  

Below, Vera and Xeroth watched from the ruins.  

*"She’s seducing him into *suicide*,"* Xeroth hissed, now a single, hunched figure with too many joints. *"Brilliant. Ruthless. I’m taking notes."*  

Vera reattached her arm with a grimace. "Focus. The moment he lets go of the choir—"  

"—we collapse the ritual’s foundation," Vera finished. "But Nyx… she’s *in* too deep."  

Above, Nyx had Malak Vorth exactly where she wanted him—kneeling, eyes closed, utterly surrendered to her whisper. But then… he smiled. A slow, cruel twist of lips.  

"Foolish night-bloom," he rasped, eyes snapping open. They glowed with a sickly green light. "You think *I* am the one being seduced?" His hand shot out, fingers closing around Nyx’s throat. Dark chains of necrotic energy erupted from his palm, wrapping her wrists, her waist. "I *know* your scent. You were *his* pet once. The Master’s broken doll. And now… you deliver yourself to *me*."  

Nyx’s breath caught. Not from the chokehold—but from the memory. *The Master*. The centuries of chains. The fire. The *hunger*. For a heartbeat, the terror of her past flooded back, freezing her Chaos-fueled strength.  

Malak Vorth laughed, a dry rattle. "You are *mine* now. A queen for my new empire of shadows!"  

Then Nyx *smiled*.  

It wasn’t fear in her eyes anymore. It was *pity*.  

"You mistake hunger for power," she whispered. And she *pulled*.  

Not against his chains—but *through* them. She didn’t break free. She *unmade* them. The necrotic energy didn’t shatter; it *dissolved* into swirling motes of starlight, absorbed into her skin. Malak Vorth’s triumphant grin died as he felt his own magic *leak* out of him, siphoned away by the very void he’d tried to command.  

"You don’t command the void, little necromancer," Nyx murmured, stepping closer as he gasped, weakening. "The void *is* me." She pressed her palm flat against his chest again. This time, it wasn’t a caress. It was an execution. "And it *hungers*."  

The spire exploded in silent, violet light.  

---  

Back at the bar, Damien set down his teacup. A single, satisfied nod.  

Lorain glared. "You sent her into *that*? After what she’s been through?"  

Damien’s eyes held galaxies. "She needed to know she could face the memory… and *win*." He glanced toward the door as it shimmered open. Nyx stepped through, her gown pristine, eyes blazing with hard-won triumph. Her wings—dark as a raven’s shadow—were furled tight.  

She didn’t look at Damien. She looked at Vera and Xeroth, who’d just stumbled in, Vera still covered in grave dirt, Xeroth now a disgruntled badger.  

"Well?" Nyx asked, voice steady. "Who’s buying the first round? I believe," she added, a ghost of a smirk touching her lips, "someone owes me for *not* letting a necromancer turn me into his ‘queen’?"  

Xeroth the badger chittered. *"Artistic risk! Worth every near-death experience!"*  

Vera just tossed her a bottle of bloodwine. "Next time," she growled, "stick to *distracting*."  

Damien watched Nyx laugh—a sound like shattering chains—and felt something warm bloom in his ancient chest.  

Chaos didn’t just destroy.  

Sometimes, it set you free.
