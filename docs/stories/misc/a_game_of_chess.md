# A Game of Chess

The office of Death was not what one might expect.

No skulls, no flickering candles, no endless void. Instead, it was a modest, if slightly oversized, room with warm mahogany paneling, a large obsidian desk that seemed to drink in the light, and a wall of filing cabinets stretching into a horizon that didn’t quite obey the laws of physics. A nameplate on the desk read simply: *D.* A steaming cup of Earl Grey sat beside a stack of interdimensional incident reports. Death himself—tall, pale, dressed in a well-tailored charcoal suit with a black tie that subtly shifted like smoke—leaned back in his chair, rubbing the bridge of his nose.

Before him stood Reaper-472, a lanky figure in the standard-issue grey hooded robe, his scythe leaning against a potted fern that technically shouldn’t exist in this dimension. His hollow eye sockets were currently narrowed in what might have been indignation.

"So let me get this straight," Death said, voice calm but edged with the weight of ten million exasperated sighs. "You *allowed* a mortal—a *medieval jester*, no less—to challenge you to a game of chess… for his soul?"

"He invoked the *ancient pact*," Reaper-472 insisted, voice echoing like wind through a crypt. "Said it was written in the Codex of Mortal Gambits, Article Twelve, Subsection Gamma—"

"There is no *Codex of Mortal Gambits*," Death snapped. "That’s *fiction*. A *story*. Told by drunk bards to scare children and justify bad life choices."

"But he *quoted* it! With footnotes!"

Death pinched the bridge of his nose again. "Reaper, I *created* you. I carved your essence from the silence between heartbeats. I gave you a scythe, a schedule, and *very clear instructions*: reap the dying, do not engage in recreational soul-bargaining, and *for the love of entropy*, do *not* play games with mortals."

"But sir," Reaper-472 leaned forward, "he was *good*. And he had snacks. Pickled eggs. I’ve never had pickled eggs."

Death stared.

"You… lost a soul… because of *pickled eggs*?"

"Well, I didn’t *lose*—I *postponed*. Indefinitely. Until the game concludes."

"Which could be *forever*, Reaper. He could just *not move*."

"Exactly! That’s the brilliance! Stalemate of the soul!"

Death stood. The room darkened. The tea cup cracked. The fern wilted slightly.

"Listen to me," he said, voice low, resonant with the finality of collapsing stars. "There is no loophole. No game. No bargain. Death comes for all. That is the *point*. If word gets out that you can *chess your way out of dying*, the multiverse will descend into anarchy. Mortals will start *training*. There will be *chess academies*. *Tournaments*. *Grandmasters of Evasion*."

He sighed, the sound like a tomb sealing.

"And worse—*Damien will hear about this*."

At the mention of the Eternal King, even the air in the office flinched.

Last time Damien found out a Reaper was playing games with souls, he’d turned the entire Netherplane into a carnival for a century. There were still cotton candy stains on the Astral Veil.

"I’ll fix it," Reaper-472 said quickly. "I’ll go back, collect the soul, no more games—"

"No," Death said, already pulling a form from the void. "You’re benched. Mandatory re-education. Three eons of observing natural causes. Maybe you’ll learn respect for the process."

The Reaper groaned. "But sir—"

"Out."

With a flick of Death’s wrist, Reaper-472 dissolved into a puff of melancholy fog.

Death sat back down, poured himself a fresh cup of tea from a kettle that hadn’t been there a moment before, and reached for the next file.

Then he paused.

A faint, familiar *chime* echoed through the office.

The interdimensional doorbell.

Death frowned.

No one visited. *No one.*

Except—

The door to his office—the one marked *Do Not Enter. Seriously.*, inscribed with runes older than time—creaked open.

And in strolled *him*.

Damien, the Eternal King, wearing the form of a man in his thirties with a smirk that could unravel fate, dressed in a velvet coat lined with stars. His eyes—shifting constellations—gleamed with unholy amusement.

"Did I hear something about *chess*?" Damien asked, stepping inside like he owned the void itself. "And *pickled eggs*?"

Death closed his eyes.

"Go away, Damien."

"Now, now," Damien said, snapping his fingers. A small chessboard appeared between them, floating in midair, pieces carved from bone and shadow. "Let’s talk *rules*."
