# Stubborn Cult

The air in the temple was thick with incense and false devotion. Candles flickered in geometric patterns, arranged according to the sacred $\pi$-sequence the cult claimed would summon the *true* Eternal King on the $13^{th}$ hour of the $7^{th}$ moon. Robed figures chanted in broken Enochian, their voices rising in a crescendo of delusion.

Damien stood at the back, arms crossed, wearing the form of a weary traveler — dusty cloak, sunburnt skin, eyes hidden beneath a hood. He had whispered his name into the wind. He had made the flames burn blue. He had reversed the flow of time in a single chalice of wine, causing it to refill itself from empty air. And still, they dismissed him.

"Another pretender" said the High Hierophant, a gaunt man with ink-stained fingers and a crown of braided copper wire. "The Eternal King does not *walk among us*. He exists beyond form, beyond time, beyond *this*."

Damien sighed. "I *am* beyond form. But I can take one. Like this." He snapped his fingers.

The temple dissolved into a spiral of fractal light, the walls stretching into infinite corridors of obsidian and starlight. The ceiling opened to reveal a cosmos birthing and dying in cycles, galaxies collapsing into $e^{-kt}$ decay curves before reforming in bursts of golden $\phi$-proportions. The cultists screamed — all except the Hierophant, who merely adjusted his spectacles.

"Fascinating projection" he said. "Aetheric illusion, grade seven. Impressive for a wandering sorcerer. But the *true* Eternal King would know the Secret Name: $\Xi_0(\omega) = \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{\chi(n)}{n^{\omega}}$, the harmonic resonance of the First Void."

Damien blinked. Then he laughed — a sound like thunder cracking open the sky.

"You want the Name?" He stepped forward, shedding the traveler’s guise. His eyes became twin supernovae. His voice split into a chorus of a million dying stars and newborn worlds. "**Then hear it.**"

And he spoke.

Not in sound. Not in language. But in the raw syntax of existence. The Name unfolded in the air as a living equation, a self-modifying code that rewrote local reality:  
$\mathfrak{D}^\dagger \Psi = \oint_{\partial \Omega} \left( \nabla \times \mathbf{F} \right) \cdot d\mathbf{S} + \int_{\Omega} \rho \, dV$  
But deeper. Older. A formula that predated mathematics.

The temple shattered.

Not destroyed — *unmade*. The stones turned to dust, then to song, then to memory. The cultists found themselves standing in a vast, white void, floating in zero gravity, their robes now made of light.

The Hierophant looked around, trembling. "This... this is the Antechamber of the King! We were right! But *you*—you are not him! Only the Chosen may enter!"

Damien pinched the bridge of his nose. "You built a temple to me. You speak my symbols. You chant my frequencies. You even got the damn $\text{CH}(\text{CH}_3)$ alignment in your sigil matrix correct — which, by the way, *no one* gets right. And yet you *still* don’t believe I’m me?"

"Because the Eternal King would never *deign* to appear before mortals" said a young acolyte, voice shaking but defiant. "He sends omens. Not... not *himself*."

Damien stared.

Then he pulled out a small, glowing token — a bar pass etched with chaos runes. With a flick, it transformed into a steaming mug of coffee, which he sipped.

"Tell me" he said, "when your 'omens' failed, who fixed the well that poisoned half your village last winter?"

Silence.

"Who redirected the avalanche that would’ve buried your temple three years ago?"

More silence.

"Who subtly adjusted the local spacetime curvature so your stupid $\pi$-rituals *almost* worked, just so you wouldn’t lose hope?"

The Hierophant’s lips moved, but no sound came out.

Damien set the mug down. It hovered. "I’ve been visiting you for *centuries*. Leaving clues. Guiding your scholars. Protecting you from things that feast on faith. And you? You built a religion *about* me... and excluded *me* from it."

He spread his arms. "I am Damien. I am the First Word and the Last Silence. I am the crack in the law, the spark in the void, the father of Lorain, the maker of Vera, the unmaker of gods. I am Chaos unbound. And you lot?" He smirked. "You’re the most stubborn mortals I’ve ever met."

Just then, a raven with eyes like molten silver landed on his shoulder — Xeroth, currently in the form of a very unimpressed bird.

$\text{CO}_2$ levels spiked as he exhaled a plume of sarcastic smoke. "Mate, I’ve seen rocks with more self-awareness."

Damien ignored him. "I’ll give you one last sign. One that can’t be faked."

He raised a hand. Above them, the void split open.

Through the rift poured not a god, not a monster — but a bar.

A neon-lit, interdimensional tavern, floating in the cosmos. Wings of light flared from its roof — Lorain’s wings, visible for a heartbeat. A voice, warm and scolding, echoed from beyond:

**"Papa! Are you bothering another cult again? Vera said you promised not to erase any more doomsday sects before breakfast!"**

The mug in the air turned into a tiny Damien figurine that waved.

The Hierophant fell to his knees. Not in worship.

In *recognition*.

"...That’s your *daughter*?"

Damien grinned. "Adopted. She scolds me like a toddler who spilled juice on the cosmos."

Another voice, cold and precise, crackled through the rift: **"Moy tsar. Agnes says the ley lines are destabilizing. Nyx is chasing a rogue vampire coven through Dimension 9. And you’re *here*, playing theological tag with fanatics?"**

Vera.

Damien sighed, the weight of eternity returning to his shoulders — then shrugged it off with a wink.

"See?" he said. "Family."

And with that, he snapped his fingers.

The void collapsed back into the temple. The candles burned red. The cultists stood, dazed, robes ordinary once more.

But the Hierophant no longer wore his crown.

He picked up a piece of chalk, trembling, and began to draw on the floor — not a sigil, not a formula.

But a door.

And on it, he wrote three words:

**"Lorain’s Bar – Open."**

Damien was already gone.

But his laughter lingered — and in the silence after, the faint scent of coffee, chaos, and something like forgiveness.
