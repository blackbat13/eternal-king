# Roll the Dice

Xeroth, currently lounging behind the polished obsidian counter of Lorain’s bar in the form of a sleek black panther with eyes like molten gold, flicked his tail with quiet amusement. His voice, smooth and laced with ancient mischief, purred through the dim, flickering light of the interdimensional tavern.

"Come now" he drawled, shifting one paw idly, claws retracted. "One more round. Double or nothing. Or triple, if you’re feeling *bold*."

The patron—a hulking, six-armed trader from the Shattered Rings of K’thar—growled low in his throat, mandibles twitching. He slammed three pulsating chrono-crystals onto the table. "You’re cheating, beast."

Xeroth tilted his head, ears twitching. "Me? Cheat? I’m wounded." He batted a paw, and the crystals vanished—only to reappear stacked neatly in front of him. "Unless *you* brought the rigged dice? Oh wait—no, those were *mine*. My apologies. Must’ve gotten mixed up."

Laughter erupted from a corner booth where Agnes sat, her fiery hair coiled like a resting serpent, glowing faintly with amusement. "He’s not cheating, Borvak. He’s just older than probability itself. You’re playing dice against a being who taught chaos theory to the first mathematicians in the void."

Borvak snarled and stomped out, the dimensional door wobbling like liquid as he passed through.

Lorain fluttered down from the upper balcony, her wings of shimmering violet and black chaos-light folding behind her. She landed lightly beside Xeroth, arms crossed. "You’re going to bankrupt every traveler between dimensions at this rate."

"And?" Xeroth shifted into a dapper, top-hatted raccoon with a monocle, spinning a golden coin on one clawed finger. "They keep *coming back*. It’s not my fault mortals have a gambling problem and immortals have *hubris*."

Just then, the air *rippled*.

A cold wind howled through the bar, extinguishing half the candles. The patrons froze.

From the shadows stepped Nyx.

She was a storm given form—pale as moonlight, hair like smoke, eyes twin voids that swallowed the light. Her long coat billowed as if caught in an unseen gale. She didn’t walk so much as *unfurl* into the room.

"You’ve been using my dice" she said, voice low and edged with thunder.

Xeroth blinked. "Your… dice?"

Nyx held out a hand. In it hovered three obsidian cubes, each etched with runes that pulsed like heartbeats. "These were forged in the blood of my first master. I *blessed* them. They don’t just roll fate—they *remember* it."

Xeroth’s raccoon ears flattened. "Ah. That explains why the odds were so… *personal*."

Lorain groaned. "Oh no. You used *cursed* dice? Xeroth, those aren’t just gambling tools, they’re *relics*."

Before he could respond, the dice in Nyx’s hand *shattered*.

A wave of energy exploded outward.

The bar *twisted*.

Walls melted into starfields. The floor became a spinning roulette wheel of fractured realities. Patrons yelped as they were flung into floating game tables suspended in the void—poker with demons, chess with time-lost kings, slots powered by screaming souls.

And in the center, rising from the chaos, a massive, spectral wheel began to turn—its segments labeled with fates: *King*, *Fool*, *Ash*, *Gold*, *Chaos*, *Void*.

Then, a voice—deep, amused, echoing from everywhere and nowhere.

"Well, well. Looks like someone woke the game."

Damien stepped out of a folding rift in reality, wearing a velvet coat stitched with constellations, a crown of thorned lightning perched on his brow. He grinned, eyes alight with delight.

"Xeroth" he said, ruffling the raccoon’s hat with a flick, "you *idiot*. You woke the *Wheel of Fates*."

Xeroth, now a very small, very guilty-looking mouse, squeaked.

Lorain pinched the bridge of her nose. "Papa, please tell me you’re not going to *encourage* this."

Damien’s grin widened. He snapped his fingers.

The wheel spun faster.

"Encourage it?" He stepped forward, raising a hand. "I’m going to *win* it."

Nyx smiled for the first time in centuries.

And the game began.
