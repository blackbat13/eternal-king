# Nyx

The first time Nyx tasted blood, she was already dead. Her heart had stopped beating centuries ago in a plague-ridden village outside Prague, her body stolen by a vampire lord who’d found her corpse still warm. He didn’t ask. He didn’t care. He bit her neck in a moonlit graveyard and whispered, *"Now you are mine. Forever."* And so began the *real* dying.  

For 317 years, Nyx was a weapon forged in shadow. Her master—a creature older than castles, crueler than winter—bred her for hunger. He starved her for weeks, then sent her into villages to feed, forcing her to choose: *kill innocents and live, or starve and beg for mercy*. She chose survival. Always. She slit throats in silk gowns, drained nobles in candlelit parlors, and once, weeping, drank from a child who’d offered her bread. Her master laughed as she vomited the blood afterward. *"You are weak"* he’d hiss, burning her palms with holy water. *"A vampire who cares deserves to burn."*  

She learned to bury her soul.  
She stopped seeing faces. Only pulses. Only prey. She became *Nyx*—the Night Stalker—a myth whispered in taverns: *"Beware the woman who moves like smoke."* But myths don’t sleep. They don’t dream. And Nyx? She dreamed of sunlight.

The night she bit **Damien**, she was starving.  

Not for blood—for *hope*.  
Her master had locked her in a cellar for failing to kill a priest. Three days without a drop. Her fangs ached like broken bones. When the cellar door finally creaked open, she didn’t think. She *attacked*.  

The man in the doorway was tall, cloaked in shadows, smelling of frost and old wine. *Mortal*, she thought. *Alone. Easy.* She lunged, fangs sinking into his neck—  

—and *shattered*.  

Not his skin. *Her fangs*. A searing pain shot up her jaw, as if she’d bitten a live wire woven from dying stars. She stumbled back, spitting silver sparks, expecting rage, holy water, *anything* mortal. Instead, the man tilted his head, amused. His neck healed instantly, leaving no mark. *"Interesting"* he mused, wiping a drop of his own blood from his collar. *"Most vampires faint at the taste of Chaos."*  

Nyx froze. *Chaos*. The word was a death sentence. Only primordials wielded Chaos. Only *gods*. She dropped to her knees, fangs bared in submission. *"Forgive me, my lord. I didn’t know—"*  

*"Of course you didn’t"* Damien cut in, crouching to meet her eyes. His gaze wasn’t angry. It was… *pitying*. *"You reek of fear. And worse—obedience."* He stood, scanning the decrepit mansion. *"Where is he?"*  

She didn’t answer. She *couldn’t*. Her master’s psychic chains still coiled around her tongue.  

Damien sighed. *"Ah. The old ways."* He snapped his fingers.  

No thunder. No explosion. Just… *silence*.  

The chains snapped. The mansion *unraveled*. Bricks turned to moths. Windows became sighs. And in the grand hall, where her master had lounged on a throne of human bones, only a pile of ash remained—still warm, still *screaming*.  

*"He’s gone"* Damien said simply. *"Permanently."*  

Nyx collapsed. Not from weakness. From *relief*. The hunger, the fear, the centuries of being *owned*—all gone. She looked up, tears cutting tracks through the dust on her cheeks. *"Why?"*  

He offered her a hand, glowing faintly with starlight. *"Because no one should be caged. Not even a vampire."*

**Rebirth** wasn’t gentle.  

Damien didn’t just free her—he *remade* her. In the Castle Between, he poured raw Chaos into her veins, not as a curse, but as a *cure*.  

*"Your master twisted nature"* he explained as silver light seared through her. *"Now I give you true night."*  

Her skin stopped burning in sunlight—it *drank* it, turning golden like dawn. Her hunger for blood became a choice, not a compulsion. And when she wept for the lives she’d taken, Damien didn’t offer forgiveness. He offered *purpose*. *"You know the taste of despair"* he said. *"Now fight for those who still drown in it."*  

Her wings came last.  
Not bat-like, but *storm-born*—vast and shadowy, edged with lightning, humming with the silence between heartbeats. When she unfurled them for the first time, they filled the throne room like a midnight sky. Xeroth, in a form of a bat, of course, clapped sarcastically. *"Show-off. Can you even carry Vera’s knives with those?"* She flicked a wingtip, sending him tumbling into a pile of sentient pillows.

Nyx doesn’t sleep in a coffin. She lounges in a canopy bed strung with constellations, reading 19th-century poetry while her wings idly fan the pages. She drinks Chaos-infused blood at Lorain’s bar—*"Nyx’s Midnight Brew"*—which tastes like blackberries and rebellion. *"None of that ‘garlic is kryptonite’ nonsense"* she scoffs, watching a mortal vampire movie. *"I marinate in it. Adds spice."*  

Her favorite pastime? **Reclaiming joy**.  

- She teaches Vera to waltz in the throne room, laughing as the assassin steps on her toes. (*"Sestra, you fight demons but fear a twirl?"*)  
- She braids Lorain’s hair with starlight, whispering stories of mortal ballrooms.  
- When Agnes’s hut catches fire (again), Nyx douses it with a flick of her wrist—and steals a s’more from the ashes.  

But the old scars linger.  
Some nights, she wakes gasping, claws buried in her sheets, smelling phantom smoke. Vera finds her then—silent, knives already drawn—and sits beside her until the shadows recede. No words. Just the weight of a sister’s shoulder against hers. *"Spasibo, sestra"* Nyx always whispers. Vera just grunts, *"Stab me if you dream of him. I’ll wake up."*
