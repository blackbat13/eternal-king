# Lorain

Lorain wasn't born in some gilded palace, but on a frozen cobblestone street in a nameless mortal city, under a moon that bled crimson from a dying king’s curse. A woman—gaunt, feverish, her breath frosting the air—clutched a newborn to her chest like a secret. She’d run for miles, bare feet bleeding, fleeing assassins who’d already slaughtered her husband and ransacked her ancestral home. All she had left was this: a daughter, swaddled in threadbare linen, her tiny fists curled against the cold. And a truth no mortal throat should carry. *They knew*. The Bratva, the Church, the shadow courts—they’d all sensed the *spark* in the child. Not magic. Not divinity. Something older. Something that *attracted* chaos like moths to flame. They’d kill her before dawn.  

So the woman did the only thing left. She knelt in the snow, pressed her lips to the babe’s forehead, and whispered a name into the void: *"Lorain."*  

Then she looked up—and saw *him*.  

Damien stood there, not as a king, but as a shadow given form. He’d come to watch empires crumble, not cradles break. But the woman’s eyes held no fear, only desperate, feral hope. She thrust the bundle into his arms. "Keep her *alive*" she rasped, her blood seeping into the snow. "Her name is Lorain. *Remember it*." Her last breath fogged the air, then vanished.  

The baby didn’t cry. She *glowed*.

A soft, golden light pulsed from her skin—the raw, untamed echo of Chaos itself, resonating with the Eternal King’s soul. Damien froze. Mortals *burned* in his presence. They shattered. They turned to ash. But this child? She *hummed* against his chest, her heartbeat a rhythm that felt like home. For the first time since Kaelen’s betrayal, his hands trembled.  

He didn’t think. He *acted*.

Pouring a thread of his own essence—not the roaring inferno of creation, but the quiet ember of *protection*—into her veins. Chaos met Chaos. Mortality fused with eternity. Her skin flared silver, then settled. Wings, translucent as dawn mist and shimmering with stardust, unfurled from her back for a single, breathless second before folding away. She cooed, grabbing his finger with a grip that could crack planets.  

*"Sparrow"* he murmured, the word raw in his throat. *"You’re my Sparrow now."*

Raising a mortal-turned-chaos-child in the Castle of the Eternal King was… *chaotic*.  

Lorain didn’t crawl—she *teleported* from the nursery to the throne room, giggling as she rearranged Damien’s celestial maps into hopscotch grids. She didn’t cry for milk—she summoned constellations into her bottle. When she threw tantrums, reality *itched*: gravity reversed in the east wing, teacups sang opera, Damien’s crown turned into a rubber chicken.

Yet Lorain’s greatest rebellion was her *heart*.

She refused to fear him. At five, she’d climb onto his lap during war councils, demanding he turn invading demon lords into "silly puppies." At twelve, she bargained with shadow assassin—*"I’ll share my chocolate if you teach me to throw knives"*. At twenty, when Damien prepared to unmake a corrupt empire, she stood before the portal, arms wide, wings flared like a shield. "*No, Papa. They’re scared. Teach them instead.*" He’d never hesitated before. But for her? He lowered his hand. The empire got a rainstorm of sentient jelly instead.  

And when the nightmares came—of the woman in the snow, of assassins hunting her in dreams—Damien didn’t just banish the shadows. He became one. Slipping into her room as a moth, a whisper, a warm hand on her fevered brow, humming lullabies in the language of collapsing stars. Xeroth, ever the menace, would shift into a stuffed bear that growled insults at her nightmares until they fled.

The Bar Between wasn’t built. It *grew*.  

Like a dandelion pushing through cosmic cracks, Lorain’s sanctuary sprouted where dimensions fray. One moment, empty void; the next, a warm-lit haven smelling of spiced rum and starlight. Patrons drifted in: time-lost samurai, weeping goblin merchants, a depressed black hole sipping espresso. Lorain moved among them—a woman frozen in her radiant thirties, wings folded like a promise, hair the color of spun sunlight. She served "Nyx’s Midnight Brew" (vampire tears, liquid shadow, and a hint of rebellion) and "Vera’s Last Shot" (brimstone, vengeance, and unexpected kindness).  

Xeroth was her chaos conductor. Today, a sentient coffee cup that judged your life choices ("*Oof. You *do* know regret isn’t a food group, right?*"). Yesterday, a jukebox playing songs from dead civilizations. He’d steal tips, knock over stools, and call her "kid" just to see her roll her eyes—but if a patron threatened her? He’d become a dragon made of shattered mirrors, reflecting their cowardice back at them. *"Mess with the Sparrow"* he’d hiss, scales glinting, *"and you answer to the storm."*  

But Lorain’s true power was her *voice*.  

When Damien visited—striding in with a grin, pockets full of turned-inside-out galaxies—she’d plant her hands on her hips, wings flaring. "*Papa. Did you turn the Vatican into a disco again?*" He’d try to deflect: "*It needed more glitter.*" She’d scold him like he’d tracked mud into the castle: "*You *unmade* the Pope’s coffee!* He had meetings!" And the Eternal King—destroyer of worlds—would sheepishly hand her a stolen artifact: "*Found this. Thought you’d like it.*" (It was usually a singing cactus.)  

The bar knew her authority. When Vera’s knives flew too close to a patron, Lorain’s glare could freeze hellfire. When Agnes’s "experimental cocktails" turned a troll into a sentient marshmallow, Lorain’s laugh could mend the rift. And when Nyx retreated into shadows, haunted by old chains, Lorain would simply sit beside her, pouring two glasses of silence until the vampire whispered, "*Spasibo, sestra.*"  

---  

They say the first time Damien laughed after the Godsnare betrayal was when Lorain, aged seven, turned his throne into a slide and zoomed down it on a stolen demon’s horn.  

They say the first time he *wept* was when she stopped aging at thirty, wings fully grown, and called him "Papa" in front of the Primordial Council—defying gods who called her "mortal filth."  

They say the universe holds its breath when she scolds him.  

But those who know Lorain best? They see the truth.  

She didn’t just save Damien. She *remade* him.  

The woman in the snow didn’t give him a daughter. She gave the Eternal King a *reason to be gentle*. And in return, Lorain—the girl who should have burned in Chaos—became its warmest, fiercest heart.  

Now, when lost souls stumble into her bar, shivering from betrayal, Lorain slides them a drink. Her wings catch the light like shattered rainbows. She doesn’t ask for names. She asks: *"What do you need?"*  

And in that moment, between dimensions, the Sparrow becomes the compass.
