# Cycle

He is born screaming, like all of them.
This time, in a crumbling apartment above a spice market in a city that doesn’t exist on any current map. The air is thick with cumin and diesel, and the walls sweat in the monsoon heat. A woman—exhausted, weeping—pulls him to her chest. The midwife cuts the cord and says, "A son. Strong."
He is not strong.  
He is *ancient*.
But he does not know it yet.

---

He grows.
He learns to walk, to speak, to steal mangoes from the vendor on the corner. He laughs easily. Cries harder. Falls in love at seventeen with a girl who paints constellations on the roofs at night. Her name is Lila. She says the stars look like unfinished sentences.
He believes her.
He believes *everything*.
Until the fever comes.
It starts as a shiver. Then fire in the blood. Then dreams—no, *memories*—of other lives.

A knight on a frozen battlefield, sword in his gut, snow filling his mouth as he whispers a name he’s never heard: *"Elira."*  
A woman in a silver gown, poisoned at her coronation, watching her sister weep over the wineglass.  
A child in a spacesuit, floating through the wreckage of a dead station, singing a lullaby in a language that died with the stars.  
A monk who walked into a volcano, smiling.

And always—*always*—the same face in the crowd.
Not watching.
*Waiting*.
Then, just before the breath stops, it comes.

**Remember.**

Not a voice. A *unfolding*. Like a scroll igniting from within. He sees it all—the thousand births, the thousand deaths, the thousand names he’s worn like borrowed coats. He sees the pattern. The spiral. The *design*.
He is not a man.

He is **Cycle**.

The turning of the wheel. The echo that refuses to fade. The universe remembering itself, over and over, in flesh.
He opens his mouth to speak—*to scream*—but the body fails.
The heart stutters.
The world goes dark.
And in that last second, he knows.

*It will begin again.*

---

He is born again.
This time, in a quiet village by a frozen lake. A boy. No name yet. The midwife hums as she wraps him in wool.
He does not scream.
He *remembers nothing*.
But sometimes, in his dreams, he tastes ash.  
Hears a lullaby.  
Sees a figure standing at the edge of a cliff, watching the sun rise—*again*.

---

Years pass.
He becomes a fisherman. Marries a woman with eyes like the thawing ice. Has two children. Forgets.
But as he kneels by the lake one winter, pulling in a net heavy with silver, he coughs.
Then collapses.
The cold seeps into his bones. His breath comes in ragged gasps. His vision blurs.
And then—*it returns*.
The knight. The queen. The monk. The child among the stars.
The face in the crowd.
Closer now.
He laughs—a wet, broken sound.

"I knew you’d be here," he whispers to no one.

The snow falls.
His fingers go numb.
And just before the light fades, he understands:
He is not cursed.
He is *necessary*.
For how can the world turn if the wheel forgets its motion?
How can life learn if it remembers every death?
How can hope exist if it doesn’t keep coming back?
He dies smiling.

---

He is born again.
This time, in a neon-lit cradle beneath a sky of drones. A girl.  
They name her *Nia*.
She never speaks.  
But when the rain hits the city’s glass skin, she stares upward—and weeps.
Not from sadness.
From *recognition*.
And when she is old enough to dream?
She sees a lake.  
A fisherman.  
A lullaby.
And a figure—closer now—stepping out of the snow.
Watching.
Waiting.
Smiling.
Because the cycle is not broken.
It is *breathing*.
And one day, when the wheel turns full circle, when all the lives are lived and all the deaths are known—

**Cycle will remember before he forgets.**

And then?
Then the wheel will *speak*.
But not yet.
Not yet.
