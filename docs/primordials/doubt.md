# Doubt

…Wait.
Was it *he*?
I said "he." But who said that was right? Who decided the embodiment of Doubt had to be a *he*? That it had to be *anything* at all?

Maybe it was *she*.  
Maybe it was *it*.  
Maybe it was none of those, and I’ve already started wrong.

Perhaps the embodiment of Doubt doesn’t have a form. Or maybe it has too many. Maybe it shifts with every hesitation, every question, every flicker of uncertainty in a mortal mind.  
But then—was it even an *embodiment*?  
Or just… a *lack*?
No. No, that can’t be. There *is* something. I *felt* it. Or—did I just imagine I felt it because I expected to?

Let me try again.

There was—no, *is*—a being. Or… *was* there?  
They go by many names. None of them stick.  
Once, they called themself **Ves**, whispered in the dark between choices.  
Then **Mira**, when they almost believed in reflection.  
Then **Kor**, when they tried to be strong.  
Now?  
Now they aren’t sure they have a name at all.

They appear—*if* they appear—as a figure just at the edge of vision. Not shadow. Not light. A *gap*. A smudge on the air, like a fingerprint over a mirror. If you look directly, they’re gone. But in the corner of your eye—yes, *there*. A man? A woman? A child? An absence shaped like a person?
They wear a coat made of second thoughts, frayed at the cuffs. Their hands tremble—not from fear, but from the sheer effort of *being*. Every motion requires a decision. Every breath: *Should I? Can I? Am I?*

They don’t speak often.  
When they do, their voice cracks mid-sentence.  
"I am—*was*—*might have been*—here to—"  
And then they stop.  
Because what’s the point?  
Who’s listening?  
And if someone *is*, can they trust their own ears?

I once saw them meet Damien.
Or—did I?
Was it *really* me? Or am I remembering a story someone else told? Or a dream? Or a lie I told myself to feel important?
But—*if* it happened—here’s how it went.

Damien stood in the ruins of a dead dimension, laughing, kicking through the ashes of collapsed timelines. He turned, saw the figure trembling in the static fog.

"Oh," he said, grinning. "You."

The figure flinched. "I—I don’t know if that’s me."

Damien tilted his head. "You’re the one who doubts everything. Even your own doubt."

"I—*do I*?" The figure shrank. "Maybe I don’t. Maybe I’m pretending. Maybe I’m not even real."

Damien stepped closer. "But you’re *here*."

"Am I? Or are you imagining me? Or—worse—*pitying* me?"

Damien’s smile softened. Not mocking. Not kind. *Curious*.

"You know," he said, "I’ve unmade gods. Shattered laws. Turned truth into punchlines. But you? You’re the only one who makes *me* wonder if any of it matters."

The figure looked up. "You… doubt?"

"No," Damien said. "But I wonder what it would be like to."

And for the first time, the figure *almost* smiled.
Then the moment passed.
And they weren’t sure it had happened at all.

Do *I* believe this story?
I don’t know.
Maybe it’s true.
Maybe it’s not.
Maybe the embodiment of Doubt isn’t a being at all—maybe it’s *this very text*, stumbling over itself, second-guessing every word, erasing its own footprints.
Maybe *you* doubt it too.
And if you do…
Then perhaps, just for a moment…
They were real.
Or—wait.
Were they?

I don’t think I should have started this.
