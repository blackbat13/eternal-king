# Four Horsemen

It started as a joke.
That’s the truth. The whole, ridiculous, universe-rattling truth.
Damien was drunk—on starlight, on irony, on the tears of a fallen archangel—and he was flipping through a mortal prophecy scroll one evening, lounging on a comet’s tail, feet kicking in the void.
He read it. Snorted.
Then said, loud enough for the cosmos to *almost* hear:  

**"Four Horsemen? Seriously? That’s the best you’ve got? Why not make it dramatic? Add some flair. Make it… *iconic*."**

And with a flick of his fingers, he *seeded* the idea.
Not the wars.
Not the plagues.
Not the rot in the fields or the silence in the granaries.
Those were already there.
But the *story*?
The *four horsemen* riding in order, cloaked and grim, fulfilling some grand design?
That was *his*.
A prank.
A cosmic meme.
And mortals?
They ran with it.
Wrote books. Painted frescoes. Screamed in temples.

And so, **War**, **Pestilence**, **Famine**, and **Death**—who had never even *met* as a group before—became… *a brand*.

---

**War** hates it.
Not the war. Never that.
War *loves* war.
War *is* war.
But the *title*? The *costume*? The *expectations*?
"Horsemen of the Apocalypse"? Please.
War is not a *Horsemen*. War is the *explosion beneath the horse*. War is the reason the horse doesn’t exist anymore. War is the *idea* that maybe peace was just a typo.

War doesn’t wear armor.
War wears *noise*.
A suit stitched from the echoes of every battle cry ever screamed. Boots that leave footprints of fire and shrapnel. A voice that isn’t heard—it *vibrates* in your molars.
War doesn’t choose sides.
War *is* the side.
And when War walks into a room—any room, any world, any dimension—people start screaming before they remember *why*.
They just *know*.
Something is about to break.
And War?
War just grins.
And says, **"Finally."**

---

**Pestilence** is confused.
Not weak. Not kind. Not *mild*.
Just… *misunderstood*.
Pestilence doesn’t *want* to be on the list.

"I mean," Pestilence says, sipping tea in a neon-lit café in a dimension where biology is optional, "one minute I’m minding my own business—evolving a virus that only affects sentient mold—and suddenly I’m in *prophecies*? With *horses*? I don’t even *like* horses."

Pestilence looks like a librarian. Thin, pale, glasses perpetually sliding down their nose. They wear a lab coat made of petri dishes, each one glowing with a different strain. Their breath smells faintly of antiseptic and regret.

"I don’t *spread* disease," they mutter. "I *refine* it. I *perfect* it. There’s art in a good pandemic. Symmetry. Balance. A beautiful incubation period."

And yet—somehow—mortal myths keep replacing them.
Not with something *worse*.
With **Conquest**.
As if *that’s* an upgrade.

Pestilence throws their hands up. "Conquest? That guy? He’s just War with better PR! I *literally* collapse civilizations from within! I make kings cough up their crowns! And they replace *me* with a guy on a white horse holding a flower?!"

They sigh.

"Damien did this, didn’t he?"

A raven cackles from the ceiling.
It might be Xeroth.
It might be a coincidence.
There’s no difference.

---

**Famine** says nothing.
Famine doesn’t need to.
Famine walks into a banquet, and the food turns to ash on the plate.
Famine stands in a field, and the roots forget how to grow.
Famine whispers, and the word *enough* disappears from the language.

Famine is tall. Gaunt. Not from starvation—Famine could never starve. Famine *is* starvation. Their skin is stretched parchment over bones that seem too long, too sharp. Their eyes are hollow, but not empty—filled with the *memory* of fullness, of warmth, of soup on a winter night.

They wear a coat made of empty sacks.
Their footsteps leave no mark—because the ground forgets they were there.
Famine doesn’t rage.
Famine doesn’t gloat.
Famine just… *arrives*.
And when they do, the world learns a new word.
*Less*.

---

They met once.
Not by design.
By *rumor*.
Damien had sent them all invitations—etched on bullet casings, written in the genome of a dying sparrow, whispered by a starving child in a dream.

*"You’re famous now. Might as well meet."*

They gathered in a ruined colosseum on a dead world.
War was already fighting the shadows.  
Pestilence was taking notes on the local bacteria.  
Famine was sitting, silent, making a single grain of rice disappear over and over.

And then—Death came.
Not on a horse.
On foot.
Cloaked. Calm. The galaxies swirling in their gaze.
They looked at the three.
And said, **"You’re not Horsemen."**

Pause.

**"You’re symptoms."**

War laughed. "Damn right I am."

Pestilence adjusted their glasses. "I prefer *catalyst*."

Famine said nothing.
Death turned to leave.
Then stopped.

**"And Damien?"** they said, without looking back. **"He’s the diagnosis."**

And with that, They stepped into the dark.
Leaving the three alone again.
Still not a *group*.
Still not *legendary*.
Still just… what they are.

---

And somewhere, in a bar between dimensions, Damien raises a glass, eyes sparkling with mischief.

"To the Four Horsemen!" he declares. "May they never live it down!"

Lorain rolls her eyes.
Vera mutters in Russian.
Agnes sets the menu on fire—*just because*.
And Xeroth, now a fox wearing a tiny hat, whispers:

**"Best prank ever."**

And the universe?
It keeps believing the story.
Because even lies become real—if enough people *fear* them.
