## Betrayal

There is a name.
But it will not be spoken here.
Not by me.
Not by *you*.
Because names have power.
And *his* name?
It doesn’t just call him.
It *wounds*.
Even the air refuses to hold it.

Say it aloud, and your tongue will taste of rust.  
Say it twice, and the person you love most will flinch at your voice.  
Say it three times?

You’ll find a knife between your ribs—cold, sharp, *familiar*—and no memory of who put it there.

He is **Betrayal**.

Not the act.
Not the feeling.
The *origin*.
The first lie.
The first broken vow.
The hand that smiled while it turned the key.

He does not walk.
He *slips*.
Into conversations.
Into promises.
Into the space between "I love you" and "but."

He wears many faces—none of them his own, all of them true. A friend’s grin with the eyes of a stranger. A lover’s touch that leaves frostbite. A brother’s hand on your shoulder—just before it shoves you into the dark.

And his weapons?
Knives.
Always knives.
Forged from silence, tempered in trust, edged with the weight of *almost*. They do not bleed you.
They *unmake* you.
Not your flesh.
Your faith.
One cut, and you remember the first time someone said they’d stay—and didn’t.  
Another, and you see every secret kept, every lie disguised as kindness.
A third?
And you start to wonder if *you* were the one who betrayed *them*.

That’s his gift.
That’s his curse.

Once, long ago, when Damien still walked among mortals, still *cared*, still healed the sick and raised the fallen—he believed.
He gave them knowledge.
He gave them fire.
He gave them *chance after chance*.
And they used it to build prisons.
To enslave the weak.
To crucify the different.
To sell their own for coin and comfort.
He wept.
Not in anger.
In *grief*.

And then—*he was betrayed*.

Not by one.
By many.
A council of kings, priests, and scholars—anointed by the people, armed with lies. They called him *demon*. *Tyrant*. *False god*.
And they came for him.
With chains of frozen light.
With arrows dipped in forgotten names.
With *knives*.

But not mortal knives.
These were different.
They *screamed* as they cut.
They didn’t just pierce flesh.
They pierced *chaos*.

And when Damien fell—bleeding starlight, his form unraveling like thread pulled from a tapestry—he looked up.
And saw *him*.
His brother.
Standing in the shadows.
Smiling.
Holding the hilt of the blade still buried in Damien’s chest.
The knife was black, not with soot, but with *absence*—as if it had cut a hole in reality itself. And around it, the air *wept*.
Damien tried to rise.
Failed.
Blood—no, not blood, but *essence*, raw and golden—pooled beneath him.
And all he could say—broken, raw, a whisper torn from the root of his soul—was:

**"Why, brother?"**

No roar.
No curse.
No threat.
Just that.
*Why?*

And Betrayal?
He knelt.
Placed a hand on Damien’s shoulder—gentle, almost loving.
And whispered:

*"Because someone had to teach you to stop trusting."*

Then he twisted the knife.
And vanished.
Leaving only silence.
And the taste of copper.
And the first true *hate* in the heart of Chaos.

Damien rose again.
Of course he did.
He is eternal.
But he was *changed*.
Not broken.
*Hardened*.
He no longer walked among mortals.
He watched.
From afar.
From above.
And when he acted?
It was not to save.
It was to *remake*.

And Betrayal?
He did not gloat.
He did not celebrate.
He simply… moved on.
To the next friend.
The next vow.
The next moment someone says, *"I’ll never leave you,"* and means it—*in that second*.
Because that’s when the knife cuts deepest.
When the truth shifts.
When love becomes lie.
When *almost* becomes *never*.

---

Now?
You’ve felt him.
Not as a presence.
As a *doubt*.

When your lover hesitates before saying "I love you."  
When your friend laughs a little too loud at your pain.  
When you realize the person who knows you best… might be the one who hurts you worst.

That chill?
That breath caught?
That’s not fear.
That’s *recognition*.
He is there.
Not always seen.
Never named.
But *felt*.
And if you listen—*really* listen—you’ll hear it.
A whisper.
Not in your ear.
In your *memory*.

*"You knew this would happen."*

*"You always do."*

And you’ll wonder—
Was it them?
Or was it *you*?
And in that question?
He *feeds*.

---

Damien does not speak of him.
Not to Lorain.
Not to Vera.
Not even to Xeroth, who knows all things that shift.
But sometimes—late, in the halls of his castle, when the stars outside pulse like wounded hearts—Damien stands before a black mirror.
No reflection.
Just void.
And he says, low, so no one else can hear:

**"One day, brother… I won’t ask why."**

And in the darkness, something *smiles*.
But you’ll never know if it’s Betrayal.
Or Chaos.
Or both.
