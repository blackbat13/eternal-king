# Change

Once, there was a ripple.
Not in water.
In *being*.
It had no name then. No shape. Just a flicker—like a thought reconsidered, like a leaf turning in the wind before the storm hits. It wasn’t *alive*, not at first. But it *learned* to be.
And when it did, it became **Xeroth**.

He sits now—*if* "sits" is the right word—as a raven with feathers like molten silver, perched on the barstool of Lorain’s interdimensional tavern. His eyes shift color with the light: gold, then violet, then the deep red of a dying sun. He watches Vera clean a dagger. Watches Agnes stir a potion that smells like forgotten birthdays. Watches Nyx sharpen her fangs on a whetstone made of silence.
He says nothing.
But the air hums.
Because Xeroth doesn’t need to speak to be heard.
He *is* the whisper behind the word.  
The crack in the mirror.  
The reason you suddenly change your mind mid-sentence.

He is **Change**.

Not revolution.
Not destruction.
Not progress.
Just… *different*.
The turn of the page.
The blink of an eye.
The moment you realize you’re not who you were yesterday.

## Academic Fragment — Recovered from a Burnt Manuscript

**Subject:** Xeroth, Embodiment of Change  
**Classification:** Primordial (Pre-Existential Tier)  
**Note:** Xeroth predates duality. Observed in earliest void not as entity, but as *instability in continuity*. Coalesced into form only after first paradox: "This is, but was not, and will not be."  

**Relationship with Chaos (Designation: Damien, Eternal King):**  
Mutual recognition. Not siblinghood (as with Death, Nyx, etc.), but *mirroring*. Chaos creates through disruption. Change enables through transformation. One is the storm. The other is the wind that decides where it goes.  

**Anomaly:** Xeroth remembers being nothing. Claims this is why he understands Damien—because Chaos, too, was once *only potential*.  

**Warning:** Do not assume Xeroth is passive. Change is inevitable, but not neutral. It chooses its own direction.

## Back at the bar.

The raven tilts its head.
Lorain slides a glass toward it—no liquid inside. Just shifting colors, like oil on water.

"For me?" the raven asks. Its voice is smooth, layered—like three people speaking at once.

She smirks. "Only if you stop turning my napkins into origami wolves."

The raven blinks.
Then, in a motion too fast to see, it becomes a fox—small, white, with eyes like clock faces. It knocks the glass over with its paw.
The colors spill—and rise.
Form a butterfly.
Then a child’s laughter.
Then a memory: Damien, centuries ago, standing in a ruined temple, screaming at the sky, furious that mortals had betrayed him again.
And Xeroth—then a shadow with too many edges—stepping out of the wall.
Not to comfort.
To *shift*.

"You could burn them all," Xeroth said, voice like a door creaking open. "Or… you could stop being the one who saves them."

Damien turned. "And become what?"

Xeroth smiled. "Whoever you want."

And just like that—Damien *changed*.
Not into a monster.
Not into a god.
Into something *new*.

## Poem — Found Scratched into a Stone Wall in a Collapsed Dimension

He was not born.  
He *occurred*.  

A twitch in the fabric.  
A thought that caught fire.

He wore a thousand skins  
and none of them lied.  

He found the King of Chaos  
not on a throne,  
but on his knees,  
weeping for mortals  
who would never love him back.  

And he said:  
*"You don’t need their loyalty.  
You need your own permission."*  

And Chaos rose.  
Not healed.  
Not fixed.  
But *different*.  

And Change smiled,  
because that’s all he ever wanted.  

## Now

The fox becomes a man.
Tall. Lean. Hair that shifts between black, silver, and flame-red depending on who’s looking. His coat is made of stitched-together moments: a piece of a battlefield, a scrap of a wedding dress, a thread from Damien’s first crown.
He walks to the window.
Outside, the void pulses—realities flickering like faulty bulbs.

"You feel it?" he asks, not turning.

Lorain sips her drink. "The shift?"

"Yeah. Something’s coming. A *big* change. Not destruction. Not salvation. Just… *different*."

She frowns. "Papa’s going to love that."

Xeroth laughs.
And for a second, his face becomes Damien’s.
Then it’s gone.

"He already does," Xeroth says. "We always do."

Because Chaos and Change?
They’re not brothers.
They’re *echoes*.
One is the spark.
The other is the flame’s direction.
One breaks.
The other rebuilds—into something it won’t stay.
They don’t need to speak.
They don’t need to meet.
They just *are*.

And when the universe finally asks, *"Why is nothing ever the same?"*
They’ll both smile.
And say nothing.
Because the answer?
Is already happening.

## Final Line — Spoken by a Child in a Dream, Never Woken From

"He was here. Then he wasn’t. But also—he never left."
