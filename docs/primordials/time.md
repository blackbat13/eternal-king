# Time

## [Begin Log: Entry Unknown]

Chronos walks not forward, not backward, but *through*.

They are not old. They are not young. They are the *between*, the breath held, the pause in the music, the comma in the sentence of existence. Their form shifts—not because They wish it, but because time itself refuses to be pinned down. One moment, a child with eyes like cracked hourglasses, sand still falling upward. The next, an ancient figure with skin of rusted clockwork, gears turning beneath, ticking in rhythms no mortal ear can match. Then—nothing. A silhouette carved from frozen seconds, standing still while the world blurs around Them.

They carry a *key*—a jagged, ever-melting thing forged from the first moment and the last, capable of unlocking any *when*. But Chronos does not rule time. They *are* time. And time, as They know better than any, is not a line. It is a *labyrinth*.

## [Rewind: 37 Seconds]

Chronos walks not through, but *out*.

They are not present. They are *elsewhen*. Their form is a ripple in the air, a stutter in perception. You see Them—then you remember seeing Them yesterday, though yesterday hasn’t happened yet. A woman in a coat of woven dawns, holding a pocket watch that shows no hands, only names: *"Lorain, Age 27," "Vera, Before the Fire," "Damien, Smiling."*  

They speak, but their words arrive before their mouth opens.

*"You were never late. You simply hadn’t arrived yet."*

Then: blink, their voice comes again, but older, frayed: *"You’ll understand this in three years. Or was it three minutes ago?"*

Time stutters.

## [Edit: Paragraph Deleted. Insertion: Unknown Origin]

There was a war once—not of nations, but of *moments*. A faction of rogue seers tried to freeze time at its most perfect second: a child’s laugh, a kiss under falling stars, a cup of coffee still steaming. They called it *Eternal Now*.  

Chronos came. Not in wrath. In *grief*. For to freeze one moment is to murder all others.

With a sigh, They *unwrote* the war before it began. Not by erasing it—but by folding it into a loop, a Möbius strip of conflict that plays out endlessly in a dimension no one can find. The child still laughs. The lovers still kiss. The coffee never cools. But none of it is real anymore. Only *possible*.

You’re sitting in Lorain’s bar. The air hums with interdimensional static. Xeroth is currently a obsidian raven perched on the counter, feathers shimmering like oil on water, muttering about "temporal hiccups" and "that damn clock-witch again." The door opens. No bell rings. But suddenly, everyone remembers a funeral they haven’t attended.

A woman steps in—no, *slides* in—her feet never quite touching the floor. She wears a coat stitched from film reels, each frame a different life lived. Her hair is silver, not from age, but from *overexposure*—as if she’s been developed too many times.  

Agnes looks up from her tea, fire-red hair flaring crimson. "Oh. *Now* you show up." The woman smiles. It’s not warm. It’s *accurate*.

"I was here five minutes ago," she says. "You just weren’t ready to see me."

Nyx, sharpening a dagger in the corner, growls low. "You *changed* something."

"I corrected it," the woman replies. "A man in Prague was supposed to die today. A poet. But Damien gave him a second chance—rewrote his fate. Cute. Chaotic. *Wrong*."

Lorain slams a glass down. "Papa does what he wants."

"And I," says the woman, "do what *must* be. Time is not a toy. Even for Chaos."

She turns to the mirror behind the bar. And in its reflection, she is not a woman. She is a storm of falling calendars, of melting clocks, of cities rising and crumbling in seconds. She is the pause between heartbeats. The silence after a name is called and before it’s answered. She is Chronos. And in the reflection, Damien stands beside Her. Not as enemy. Not as brother. But as *counterpart*. They touch foreheads. Not in battle. In *balance*. Then the moment shatters.

*"You think I hate him? Damien? No. I love him. He is the wild note in my symphony. The tear in my fabric. Without him, time would be perfect. And perfection… is death."*

*"So let him break the rules. Let him save the doomed, revive the dead, twist fate into knots. Because then I have something to fix."*

## [End Log: Or Is It?]

Chronos is gone. But the bar’s clock now runs backward. And in the corner, a single leaf falls *upward* into an invisible tree. Somewhere, a poet in Prague takes his first breath. And somewhere else, a moment is being rewritten. Again. And again. And *again*.
