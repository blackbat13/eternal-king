# Death

Death walks between worlds not with the heavy tread of doom, but with the quiet sigh of a breath exhaled after a long life.

They appear as the figure mortals have always feared: tall, robed in folds of blackened starlight that ripple like smoke caught in slow wind, a cowl drawn low over a face that is not empty—but *full*. Where eyes should be, there is not darkness, but the soft glow of distant galaxies, swirling in silent orbits. Their hands, when shown, are neither bone nor flesh, but shifting constellations, each fingertip a dying star collapsing into itself. The scythe they carry is not forged—it *grew*, from the first ending, the first silence, the first loss. Its blade is the edge of entropy, sharp enough to sever soul from body, dream from memory, time from consequence.

But Death is not cruel.

They do not revel in the fall of kings or the weeping of mothers. They do not hunger. They *attend*. They are the last kindness, the gentle hand on the shoulder when the road ends. They are the whisper that says, *“Rest now. You were loved. You were real. You were enough.”*

Long ago, before names had meaning, before stars learned to burn, the Primordials stirred in the void—Chaos, Death, Time, Silence, and the others—each a pulse in the dark, each a note in the first song of existence. Damien, the wild spark, the storm in the cradle of reality, once challenged Death in a game older than rules.

It happened at the edge of a dying universe, one that had flickered out like a candle in a hurricane. Damien, ever the provocateur, stood atop the last collapsing planet and laughed.

*"You claim all things, sister,"* he said, arms wide, chaos crackling in his fingers like lightning. *"But can you take what refuses to die?"*

From his palm, he raised a single ember—a soul he had stolen from Death’s own shadow, one that had slipped through the cracks of fate. It pulsed in his hand, defiant, unyielding.

Death stepped forward, not in anger, but in sorrow.

*"You delay the inevitable, brother. Not deny it. Even Chaos must end."*

*"Must it?"* Damien grinned, wild and bright. *"Or must it simply… change?"*

And with a flick of his wrist, he *rewrote* the soul—not into life, not into death, but into *story*. He spun it into a myth, a name whispered across dimensions, a legend that would never fade. A being that could not die, because it was already remembered.

Death paused.

Then, slowly, They lifted a hand—not to strike, but to *touch* the ember.

And They *laughed*.

A sound like wind through ancient trees, like the first breath after drowning.

*"Clever,"* Death said. *"But not eternal. Even stories end."*

*"Ah,"* said Damien, bowing with a flourish. *"But not tonight."*

And so, the game was drawn. Not won. Not lost. For what is a game between siblings if not an endless dance?

From that day, Death carries a single thread in Their robe—a golden filament woven through the black, the story-soul still burning, still remembered. A trinket. A jest. A secret.

And when They come for a mortal, cloaked and silent, sometimes—just sometimes—they hum a tune, low and mischievous, like a lullaby with a wink at the end.

Because Death knows Damien is watching.

And Damien knows Death will always come for him… eventually.

But not tonight.

Not while there are still stories to tell.
