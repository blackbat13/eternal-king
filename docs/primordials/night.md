# Night

She was not born.
She *fell*.
Not from grace.
From *before*.
Before light had a name. Before silence learned to echo. Before even Chaos had stirred in the void—there was **Nyx**.

Not the absence of light.
Not its opposite.
But its *mother*.

She is the first dark—the deep, breathing black that cradled the universe before it dared to burn. Not empty. Not dead. *Alive* with potential. A womb of shadow, where stars were dreamed before they were born, where every secret, every whisper, every unspoken love and hidden fear still sleeps.
She does not wear a crown.
She *is* the night.
Her skin is the velvet between galaxies. Her hair—long, flowing, impossible—ripples not with wind, but with the turning of constellations, each strand a comet’s tail, each braid a spiral arm. Her eyes are closed. They have never opened. For to see would be to *limit*. She knows all that moves in darkness without needing sight. The mouse in the grass. The thief’s hand. The tear that falls when no one is watching.

She speaks rarely.
When she does, her voice is not sound.
It is *absence*.
A pause in the storm.  
A breath held.  
A thought unfinished.
And in that silence, you hear everything you’ve ever feared—and everything you’ve ever longed for.

She and Damien were never close.
Not like siblings should be.
He, the wild spark, the first *yes* in the void—rushing, laughing, tearing holes in the fabric just to see what would pour through.
She, the first *no*.  
The hush.  
The stillness before creation.
He called her *gloomy*.  
She called him *loud*.

Once, in the earliest dark, he tried to set the night on fire.
With a flick of his fingers, he lit a thousand suns, blazing, roaring, devouring the quiet.
Nyx did not scream.
She *sighed*.
And from that sigh came the first eclipse.
The stars dimmed.  
The fire guttered.  
And Chaos—just for a moment—was *still*.
Then he laughed.
And she almost smiled.
Almost.

---

They do not fight.
They *balance*.
For every world Damien ignites with chaos, Nyx wraps in shadow to let it dream.  
For every scream he provokes, she gives the silence afterward.  
For every truth he forces into the light, she shelters the lie that keeps a heart beating.
She is not gentle.
She is *necessary*.
When mortals whisper of nightmares, she does not flinch.  
She *feeds* them.  
Not to harm.
To remind.
For without darkness, what is light but a tyrant?
Without fear, what is courage?
Without sleep, what is waking?

---

She visits him sometimes.
Not in his castle.
In the space *between*.
Where time forgets its name.
There, in the deep, she sits beside him—two primordials on a bench made of forgotten moons.
He eats stolen apples from worlds he unmade.  
She drinks silence from a chalice of cooled starlight.
They do not speak for hours.
They do not need to.

Then, softly, he says, "You’re always watching."

"I’m always *here*," she replies.

"You ever miss being the only thing that was?"

"No," she says. "But I miss the quiet."

He grins. "Then I’ll make more noise."

She does not answer.
But the night around them deepens.
Just a little.
Just enough.

---

And when, at last, all things end—when even Chaos tires, when the last star dies, when the final story is told—
She will remain.
Not to mourn.
Not to reign.
To *hold*.
As she always has.
As she always will.
For before there was anything—
There was Nyx.
And when there is nothing again?
There will be Nyx.
Still.
Quiet.
Whole.
The last mother.
The first dark.
The night that never leaves.
Even when the lights go out.
