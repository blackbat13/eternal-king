Vera used to be just a weapon, nothing more. She was twelve when she killed her first target. And fourteen when she saw her sister die in the flames. Damien found her when she struck a blade through his heart and offered her to work for him. Through the years Vera became the best assassin in the multiverse and Damien's right hand. But more importantly, she learned how to be more than just a weapon. Also, she found a new family. She calls Lorain "sestra" and Damien "moy tsar", mostly because he says he hates it. And sometimes, when she's bored, she stabs Xeroth. He deserves it, most of the time. Not like the stabbing makes any difference, he just changes into smoke, jelly or some other monstrosity.
