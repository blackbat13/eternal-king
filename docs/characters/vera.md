The first time Vera killed, she was twelve years old and wearing her sister’s stolen ballet slippers.  

Not for stealth—she’d long ago learned to move like smoke—but because they were the only shoes that fit. The target was a Bratva lieutenant who’d sold her sister into the St. Petersburg underground. Vera didn’t use a gun. Guns were noisy, messy. She used the curved knife her sister had hidden in her hair, the one Vera had taken from the corpse after the fire. She slit his throat in a brothel alley, then stood in the snow until her tears froze to her cheeks. The ballet slippers left tiny crimson footprints behind her as she walked away. *Weapon*, the Bratva had called her. *No name. No past. Just a blade that breathes.*  

She’d been six when the wolves came for her family.  

Not literal wolves—men in wolf-pelt coats, Bratva enforcers sent to collect a debt her father couldn’t pay. They took everything: the apartment, the bakery, her parents’ lives. By eight, Vera was property of the Bratva, trained to kill with needles, poisons, or the flick of a wrist. Her sister, Anya, was all she had left—until Anya tried to run. Until the Bratva burned their safehouse with Anya inside, laughing as Vera clawed at the flames, her palms blistering, her screams drowned by the roar of the fire. *"Now you’re truly mine,"* the Bratva boss had whispered, pressing a knife into her small hand. *"Kill to live. Live to kill."*  

For years, she did.  

She became a ghost in the shadows of ten thousand worlds—St. Petersburg alleys, neon-lit cyberpunk slums, desert fortresses where time bled like sand. She slit throats of warlords, poisoned emperors, and once, for a dare, filled a queen's bathtub with spiders. The multiverse knew her as *Volk*—the Wolf—but she had no name, no face, no self beyond the next target. She slept in graves, ate only to stay sharp, and kept Anya’s charred ballet slipper in her pocket like a rosary.  

Then came the night she stabbed a god in the heart.  

Damien found her in the ruins of a dead city, while he was hunting a warlord who’d trafficked souls through dimensional rifts. Vera didn’t know he was the Eternal King—just another mark, another heartbeat to silence. She lunged from the shadows, her knife sinking deep into his chest… and *stuck*. Not in flesh, but in something older, vaster—a storm given form. Damien didn’t flinch. He caught her wrist, his grip gentle as snowfall, and looked into her eyes. Not with anger. With *recognition*.  

*"You’re tired,"* he said, plucking the knife from his chest like a stray hair. *"Tired of being a weapon. Tired of burning."*  

Vera spat in his face. *"Kill me or let me go."*  

He did neither.

The Castle Between didn’t welcome her. It *tested* her.  

For months, Vera slept in the armory, surrounded by swords that whispered her failures. She tried to escape—through portals, through time, through death itself. (Damien revived her each time, sighing like a disappointed schoolteacher.) She refused to speak, ate only when Lorain slid a plate under her door, and spent hours sharpening knives that didn’t need sharpening.  

Then, one night, she found Lorain waiting in the armory.  

Sparrow—barefoot, wings half-unfurled—tossed her a glass of something that glowed like liquid starlight. *"Drink. It’s vodka infused with supernova dust. Xeroth swears it’s ‘the only thing that makes assassins less boring.’"* Vera didn’t touch it. Lorain sat cross-legged on the floor, humming a lullaby Vera’s mother used to sing. *"He sees you, you know. Not the weapon. The girl who still carries her sister’s ashes."*  

Vera lunged. Not with a knife—with her fists, screaming about betrayal, about fire, about how *no one* saw her. Lorain took every punch, let her collapse sobbing against her shoulder, and whispered, *"Sestra. You’re not alone anymore."*  

---  

Damien didn’t train her. He *unmade* her.  

He took her to worlds where gravity was a suggestion and taught her to fight blindfolded, forcing her to *feel* the space between heartbeats. He sent her to negotiate with sentient black holes, not to kill, but to *listen*. When she hesitated, he’d grin like a madman: *"Afraid to be more than a blade, little wolf?"*  

The first time she refused a kill—sparring with a demon lord who’d kidnapped children only to find he was *saving* them from a worse fate—Damien didn’t punish her. He bought her a cherry-red motorcycle made of solidified lightning and said, *"Now you’re ready."*  

She became his right hand. Not because she was the deadliest, but because she *understood* the cost of death. She learned to read lies in the twitch of an eyelid, to disarm armies with a smile, to turn enemies into allies with a well-placed truth. When empires trembled at Damien’s name, Vera was the shadow who whispered, *"Beg for mercy, and you’ll live. Fight, and you’ll die. Choose."*  

But in the Castle Between, she was *Vera*.  

Lorain dragged her to the bar for "sister nights," where Vera taught Nyx how to throw knives while Xeroth heckled them from the rafters. *"Stab me again, Zharkova,"* he’d taunt, shifting into a porcelain teacup. She’d oblige—*clink*—and he’d reappear as a smoke dragon, blowing rings into her hair. *"Bored? Good. Now pour me a drink."*  

Damien called her *"little wolf"*, and she called him *"moy tsar"*, just to watch him roll his eyes. When he raged after a betrayal, she’d stand in his path, boots planted, and say *"Enough."* When Lorain scolded him for turning a planet into sentient jelly, Vera would add *"You owe me new boots, moy tsar. The old ones melted."*  

And sometimes, in the dead of night, she’d visit Anya’s grave—a patch of earth in the Castle’s garden where no flowers would grow. She’d kneel, press her forehead to the soil, and whisper *"I’m not a weapon anymore, sestra. I’m home."*
