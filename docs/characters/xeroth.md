# Xeroth

The universe didn’t begin with silence. It began with *laughter*—sharp, irreverent, and utterly unimpressed.  

Before Damien stirred in the Primordial Soup, before Aether wove the first thread of order or Gaia coalesced into solid earth, there was **Xeroth**. Not a *force*, but the *absence of definition*—the shimmering potential of *what might be*. Where Damien was the roar of creation, Xeroth was the sly whisper in the dark: *"Why not?"* He wasn’t born; he simply *was*, as inevitable as the question mark after every cosmic "yes". While his siblings claimed grand titles—Order, Night, Earth—Xeroth shrugged. "Call me the Maybe," he’d murmur, already shifting into a falling star, then a ripple in the void, then nothing at all. He was the first shape-shifter, the original *idea* of change. And he found the whole business of creation *exhaustingly* dramatic.  

In the early days, Xeroth was Damien’s shadow and his spark plug. When Damien, wide-eyed and earnest, tried to teach fledgling mortals to build cities, Xeroth would morph into a mischievous fox and knock over their clay bricks. When Damien wept over a dying star, Xeroth became a comet and *crashed* into it—just to see if it would reignite. ("*Relax, Chaos-Boy. It’s just a supernova. Happens all the time.*") He never took sides, never claimed dominion. He’d lounge as a black hole, sipping stardust like tea, while Aether and Gaia argued over cosmic blueprints. To them, he was an irritant—a cosmic jester with no throne and no rules. To Damien, he was the only one who *got it*. The only one who saw chaos not as a weapon or a flaw, but as *fun*.  

Then came the betrayals.  

Xeroth watched, silent as a shadow, as Kaelen’s treachery cut Damien to the core. He saw the Godsnare cage bite, saw the light drain from Damien’s eyes. When Damien unmade that civilization, Xeroth didn’t cheer. He didn’t scold. He simply shifted into a smooth river stone and let Damien grip him for three mortal lifetimes, the stone growing warmer with every tear the Eternal King refused to shed. No words. Just presence.  

Afterward, when Damien built his castle between realities and donned the mantle of the Eternal King, Xeroth followed. Not as a subject, never that. As a *roommate*. He claimed the west tower—a room that changed shape hourly. When Damien brooded over maps of dying empires, Xeroth would manifest as a moth, landing on his nose. *"Still moping? How about we turn that tyrant’s beard into jellyfish? For old times’ sake?"* Damien would swat him away, but the ghost of a smile always followed.  

Xeroth’s greatest gift? **Invisibility**. Not literal—he could be a pebble on the path or a sigh in the wind—but *cosmic*. While Aether fretted over cosmic balance and Nyx (the vampire, not the primordial) brooded in her chambers, Xeroth slipped through cracks in reality, unnoticed. He knew Damien’s siblings thought him a mere "companion," a trickster spirit. Good. Less paperwork. *"Drama,"* he’d sniff, in a form of a disgruntled badger curled on Lorain’s barstool, *"is for beings who care what others think. I care about nap schedules."*  

But when Lorain was just a squalling mortal babe, Xeroth was there. He shifted into a cradle made of woven moonlight, humming a lullaby in the language of collapsing stars. When Vera, trembling after her first kill for Damien, vomited behind the castle gates, Xeroth became a loyal dog and nudged a flask of whiskey into her hand. When Agnes set her hut on fire trying to brew "chaos tea", he appeared as a raincloud—*just* over her roof. He’d never admit it, but he’d die for them. (Metaphorically. Mostly. He *has* faked his death 47 times when bored.)  

Now, centuries later, Xeroth holds court at Lorain’s bar. One moment he’s a vintage typewriter clacking out sarcastic fortunes (*"Your future: Stop spilling ale on me"*), the next a raven stealing Vera’s knife to preen his feathers. He teases Damien relentlessly—*"Still playing daddy? Adorable. Pass the whiskey, *moy tsar*."*—but when Nyx has nightmares of her vampire master, Xeroth becomes a silent wolf, pressing his warmth against her back until dawn.  

He is ancient. He is eternal. He is the reason "impossible" is just a suggestion. And if you ask him his true form? He’ll shift into a mirror and show you your own confused face. *"Primordial? Please. I’m just a guy who likes good seats at the apocalypse."*  

But sometimes, when the bar is quiet and Lorain’s wings glow soft as embers, Xeroth becomes a moth again—tiny, fragile, utterly unassuming—and lands on Damien’s shoulder. No jokes. No snark. Just two old friends, watching the multiverse spin, content in the chaos they’ve built together.  

*After all*, Xeroth thinks, *even gods need someone to call them an idiot when they’re being an idiot*.
