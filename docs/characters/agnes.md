The first time Agnes set herself on fire, she was seven years old and trying to light the oven.  

Not *metaphorically*. The wooden cottage in her remote Finnish village didn’t just catch flame—it *screamed*. Walls peeled like burnt paper, the cast-iron stove melted into liquid silver, and Agnes stood unharmed in the center of the inferno, her hair a crown of living blue fire. Her grandmother pulled her from the ashes, not with fear, but grim understanding. *"The blood of the First Spark runs in you"* she’d rasped, pressing a cold iron token into Agnes’ soot-streaked palm. *"They’ll come for you now. When they do… run."*  

The "they" arrived when Agnes turned twenty-two. **The Weavers of Order**. Cloaked figures who moved like shadows given teeth, they’d tracked her bloodline for centuries—a lineage cursed (or blessed) with *raw attunement* to magic’s delicate threads. To them, Agnes wasn’t a girl; she was a *loose end*, a mortal who could unravel cosmic balance with a stray thought. They burned her grandmother’s hut to the ground, scattering ash like cursed snow. Agnes ran, the iron token burning against her skin, as the Weavers’ whispers slithered through the pines: *"You are chaos incarnate. You must be unmade."*  

For months, she was prey.  
She slept in hollow trees, ate berries that exploded into constellations when bitten, and learned to smother her magic like a dying ember. But the fire *always* returned. A startled gasp lit her cloak ablaze. A nightmare turned her breath to dragon’s smoke. Once, grief over her grandmother made the Gulf of Bothnia *boil*. The Weavers gained ground, their silver nets glinting in every twilight. Desperate, she clutched the token—a relic from a time when her ancestors walked with primordials—and whispered the only plea left: *"Take me somewhere they can’t follow."*  

The token didn’t open a door.  
It *unstitched reality*.  

One moment: frozen Nordic forest. The next: **Lorain’s Bar**, mid-sentence as Xeroth, in a form of disgruntled badger, lectured a sobbing time-traveler about "emotional baggage." Agnes collapsed onto the floor, hair flaring like a supernova, the token smoking in her grip. Lorain was at her side instantly, wings shielding her from the bar’s curious stares. *"Breathe"* she murmured, pressing a glass of starlight into Agnes’ trembling hand. *"You’re safe here."*  

But safety came with strings.  
The Weavers could still *feel* her—a splinter in the multiverse’s skin. Damien appeared in a swirl of shattered galaxies, eyes narrowed at the token in her palm. *"Ah"* he said, plucking it from her. *"Baba Yaga’s key. No wonder they’re hunting you."* He tossed it to Xeroth. *"Hide this. And fetch the old witch. Tell her… her prodigy’s home."*

**Baba Yaga’s Hut** didn’t *have* a door—it *was* the door. A skeletal chicken-legged structure that squawked insults and kicked intruders into the Void. Agnes spent three years there, not as a student, but as *kindling*.  

The lessons weren’t gentle.  
When Agnes tried to summon rain, Baba Yaga shoved her into a hurricane. *"FEEL the threads, you *child*! Magic isn’t *control*—it’s *conversation*!"* When her hair ignited the hut’s roof (again), the old witch cackled, *"Good! Now put it OUT with your *soul*, not your hands!"* Agnes learned to weave spells from spider-silk and regret, to dance with chaos instead of fighting it. She discovered her fire wasn’t destruction—it was *purification*. A single touch could mend broken timelines or incinerate lies.  

But the Weavers never stopped hunting.  
During her final trial, they breached Baba Yaga’s realm. Silver nets rained from the sky, designed to *sever* her connection to magic. Agnes stood alone on a bridge of frozen starlight, hair blazing like a beacon. She didn’t cast a spell. She *listened*—to the hum of the multiverse, the sigh of dying stars, the Weavers’ own brittle fear. Then she *pulled*.  

Not at their nets.  
At the *chaos within them*.  

Their silver armor melted into songbirds. Their weapons bloomed into roses. The lead Weaver stared at his hands—now sprouting cherry blossoms—and fled, weeping. Baba Yaga clapped, toothless grin wide. *"Finally. You understand: magic isn’t a weapon. It’s a *mirror*."*  

---  

Agnes’ hut in the Between wasn't *built*. It **grew**.  

Like a tumor of sentient wood and moonlight, it pulses beside Lorain’s bar—a crooked cottage with bark like dragon scales and windows that blink. It grumbles when storms come (matching Agnes’ mood), brews its own tea (which occasionally bites), and once ate Xeroth for complaining about the decor. *"He deserved it"*, Agnes mutters, stirring a cauldron of liquid twilight while her hair flickers from crimson to indigo. *"The hut has standards."*  

Her role? **The Multiverse’s Janitor**.  

While Damien "redecorates" realities (turning bureaucracies into sentient origami, making coffee cups judge souls), Agnes follows with a cosmic mop. She patches rifts in spacetime with dandelion fluff and stubbornness. She soothes Nyx’s nightmares with tea that tastes like forgiveness. When Vera’s knives accidentally unmake a dimension, Agnes sighs and rebuilds it—with *fewer* jelly monsters this time.  

Her fire? Now a language.  
When she’s angry, flames crackle like Nordic folk songs. When she’s joyful, embers swirl into fireflies spelling *"sister"* for Lorain. Only once did it rage out of control—when a Weaver infiltrated the Between, whispering lies about her grandmother’s death. Agnes didn’t burn him. She *unraveled* him, thread by thread, until only a single, charred silver net remained. Damien found her weeping in the ashes, hair dim as dying coals. He said nothing. Just sat beside her, and for the first time, *listened*.  

---  

Now Agnes can be found in her witch's hut, stirring a pot of something that smells like burnt sugar and nostalgia, wearing the fireproof apron Lorain handed her, embroidered with *"Chaos Witch: Please Don’t Burn the Bar (Again)."*
