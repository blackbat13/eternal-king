Agnes first met Damien when she stumbled into Loraine's bar, clutching an ancient token in her hands, her family's heirloom. She didn't knew how she got there. She was running for past few months, hiding from unknown hunters. Agnes has an innate ability to harness magic and she managed her Chaos transformation better than most. She studied for a few years under the infamous Baba Yaga and quickly became the Chaos Witch she is today. Agnes lives in her witch hut near Loraine's bar in the place in-between dimensions, helping to maintain the balance of the multiverse, which in her eyes mostly means cleaning after Damien's mess. By the way, her hut is alive and sometimes moody, just like her fiery hair (yes, her hair is literally on fire, part of her Chaos transformation, she caused a few fires in the past, but now she got it under control, or so she claims).
