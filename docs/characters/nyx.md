Nyx's story begins with a blood, as many stories about vampires do. She was hungry, desperate, hiding in a closet in a home of a man living alone. One night, when he was sleeping, Nyx sneaked up to him, silently, and sunk her fangs into his neck. But it turned out that this wasn't just any mortal she has bitten. In fact, it wasn't a mortal at all. It was Damien. Now, Nyx's lives in his castle, her former master turned to ash when Damien snapped his fingers, and drinks Chaos-infused blood in Loraine's bar. And she laughs when watching movies about vampires, because of how mistaken mortals are in their depiction of her kind.
