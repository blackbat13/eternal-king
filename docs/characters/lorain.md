# Lorain

Lorain is Damien's adopted daughter and the first mortal to call him "Papa". When Damien was travelling mortal worlds, he found a dying woman sitting on an empty street in the cold night, clutching a baby to her chest. She pressed that baby into Damien's surprised arms, and the last words before she died were the baby's name: Lorain. Since that day Damien raised Lorain in his castle between dimensions, imbuing Chaos into her veins so she could actually survive his parentship. Lorain became the first mortal turned immortal in Damien's new family. She runs an interdimensional bar now, offering drinks to travelers from across the multiverse. Xeroth keeps her company and makes sure that it's never boring at the bar. Lorain calls him a menace, but she doesn't hide her smile when she does so. Damien visits her frequently and brings creative Chaos with him. Those who knew Damien for a long time says that he changed a lot since he met Lorain. Sure, he is still a scary Eternal King, but he smiles a lot now, laughs a lot, and instead of unmaking cities he now sometimes turns buildings into sentient jelly or makes morning coffee judge your life choices. Still, Lorain makes sure that he behaves, as she is the only being in existence that can scold him and live to tell the tale.
